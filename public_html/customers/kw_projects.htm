      <h2 align="center"><b><font color="#666666">Researchers use KnowledgeWright 
        <br>
        to Develop Advanced Expert Systems</font></b></h2>
      <p>KnowledgeWright is the tool of choice for a number of academic researchers 
        to deliver a wide range of projects from undergraduate to advanced degrees. 
        These projects illustrate the flexibility and power of the KnowledgeWright 
        architecture. </p>
      <h3>Protecting Slopes from Erosion</h3>
      <p><img src="kw_jorge_slope.jpg" width="286" height="184" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="2">Jorge 
        Chou is a Masters student at the National Central University in Taiwan. 
        He developed an expert system to provide advice about how to protect slopes 
        from erosion or other damage from construction. Jorge starting working 
        with KnowledgeWright while it was in beta test. He worked closely with 
        Amzi! to allow the user's interactions with the knowledgebase to be in 
        Chinese, and he was able to edit and debug the rules all in Chinese. Although 
        he searched the Web for several months, KnowledgeWright was the only product 
        that providing him with the ability to build and deploy a system entirely 
        in his native language.</p>
      <p>Jorge's website uses a combination of tools to support his web-based 
        expert system. He uses JSP and KnowledgeWright's ready-to-run Web interface 
        to host the knowledgebase. It was important to Jorge to use tools off-the-shelf, 
        so that instead of spending time developing the user interface, he could 
        focus his efforts on coding his expertise into the knowledgebase. He uses 
        KnowledgeWright's Web interface which does all the work of interacting 
        with the user for him. Jorge's knowledgebase has HTML tags in the text 
        to provide the formatting he requires. The knowledgebase asks the user 
        about the slope that needs to be protected and the conditions under which 
        such protection is to be provided. It uses pictures such as the one here 
        to illustrate methods to protect the slope.</p>

      <h3>Identifying Cars</h3>
      <p>Richard Benson is a BSc student at the University of Surrey in the U.K. 
        His project for the &quot;Intelligent Systems&quot; course was to build 
        an expert system to identify a car based on whatever parts of the car 
        a user has seen (e.g. doors, grill, lights, bumpers). The knowledgebase 
        displays pictures for most of the questions so the user does not need 
        to know about cars in general or models in particular. Also, the user 
        can answer &quot;I don't know&quot; to any of the detailed questions. 
      </p>
      <p><img src="kw_carscreen.gif" width="238" height="202" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="6">The 
        system was built to run under IIS and uses an Access database to store 
        the characteristics of the cars. The knowledgebase reasons over SQL queries 
        (using ODBC) to identify the car. The database includes 470 car models 
        built by Ford during the last six years.</p>
      <p> Richard chose KnowledgeWright for a number of reasons, the most significant 
        of which was the extensive and easy to follow tutorials. These tutorials 
        were unsurpassed by other tutorials he tried with other products that 
        left him with little or no understanding of how to approach the shell 
        to make it do what he needed it to do. KnowledgeWright was easy-to-use; 
        especially when debugging his knowledgebase. The log screen let him see 
        exactly what values have been inferred and which facts have been found. 
        Also KnowledgeWright's ready-to-run Web runtime gave him an easy way to 
        create a user interface as he had a very limited understanding of programming, 
        but a good knowledge of HTML. The Web runtime allowed Richard to make 
        his knowledgebase look good, and allowed him to use images within the 
        questions to aid the users decisions. Without this runtime, Richard would 
        only have been able to demonstrate his knowledgebase from within the KnowledgeWright 
        Workshop, thus making it inaccessible to anyone without a copy of the 
        Workshop.<br>
        <br>
        This was the first knowledgebase Richard had built and thanks to KnowledgeWright 
        he found it a lot easier than he expected. He also believes he has just 
        begun to scratch the surface of KnowledgeWright's potential, and in the 
        hands of an experienced knowledgebase engineer it would be an incredibly 
        powerful tool. </p>
