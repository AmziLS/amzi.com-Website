        on the Web with Amzi!</font></h2>
      <h3>Company Background</h3>
      <p><img src="strandware_barcode.gif" width="100" height="71" align="right">StrandWare, 
        Inc. is a leading developer of label design, printing, and tracking software 
        for worldwide industrial and business applications. StrandWare's family 
        of products has helped bar code technology evolve from supermarket and 
        stand-alone applications to high tech, enterprise-wide solutions. Asset 
        management, time and attendance, inventory control, and a myriad of other 
        applications have been made more efficient through the use of proven bar 
        code technology. StrandWare software has enabled companies from small 
        manufacturers to Fortune 500 retailers to reduce labor costs by 30% and 
        achieve an 80% reduction in inventory returns.</p>
      <p>Quality products and a strong commitment to customers has enabled StrandWare 
        to increase its installed base to over 110,000 users in 80 countries around 
        the globe. The commitment to customers remains Strandware's top priority, 
        and servicing their large customer base has required both excellent people 
        and products.</p>
      <p>These fundamentals are supplemented by new technologies that keep StrandWare 
        ahead of its competition. This article describes one such technology, 
        an automated expert system based support system, available to customers 
        on its Web site.</p>
      <h3>Support Problem</h3>
      <p>As with most software companies, many of the technical support issues 
        revolve around problems that keep repeating. In particular, Strandware's 
        business requires knowing a lot about all the various printers they support 
        and how to set them up for optimal performance with their products.</p>
      <p>They will often, for example, get customers having similar printing problems 
        on a particular brand of printer, and that problem can be resolved by 
        knowledgable twiddling of the configuration. The trick is making sure 
        all of their support people can find the right answers for all the possible 
        combinations of operating systems, printers and drivers that their customers 
        might have.</p>
      <h3>Support Solution</h3>
      <p>A Web-based technical support solution provides a number of benefits 
        for both Strandware and its customers. First, and most obviously, it can 
        directly solve a certain percentage of customer support issues. This means 
        the customer got a quick solution, and tech support time is saved for 
        the harder issues.</p>
      <p>Second, it acts as a filter for human technical support. When a customer 
        does not get a resolution to a problem, an e-mail is sent to technical 
        support, containing all of the information the customer entered while 
        describing and trying to resolve the issue. This means the technical support 
        people are not wasting either theirs or the customers time gathering preliminary 
        information.</p>
      <p>Third, the system gathers the data from the Web-based support sessions, 
        providing a valuable resource for analyzing customer problems and configurations. 
        This data can be used to directly drive product development and documentation 
        in directions that will increase future customer satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Over the last two months they have been averaging close to 100 technical 
        support sessions per month on the Web site, and about 80% of those have 
        resulted in a resolution for the customer. The other 20% have triggered 
        e-mails to technical support.</p>
      <h3>Operation</h3>
      <p>When the customer starts a support session, they are asked for some initial 
        information, such as contact information and the product they have a question 
        about. The system uses that initial information to filter the rules that 
        might apply, and gathers additional information as needed in its search 
        for a resolution.</p>
      <p><img src="strandware_middle.gif" width="681" height="475"></p>
      <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows a question from the middle of an automated support session. 
        In this example the user is looking for help with a smudging problem on 
        a printer.</p>
      <p>That particular session led to a relatively long answer, not shown for 
        space reasons, that detailed the settings that could be used to control 
        the quality of printing of various printers. The particular problem is 
        indicative of the type of expertise StrandWare must have to support it's 
        customers.</p>
      <p><img src="strandware_end.gif" width="681" height="485"></p>
      <p><i>Figure 2</i></p>
      <p>Figure 2 shows an answer from a different session that is indicative 
        of the sorts of support issues all software vendors in the ever-changing 
        Windows world have to cope with.</p>
      <p>The Web pages for both figures 1 and 2 were dynamically generated by 
        the expert system in response to the data entered by the user.</p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>The system was implemented using Amzi!'s WebLS product. WebLS is a simple 
        expert system tool, designed specifically for deploying expert systems 
        on the Web. It carries on a dialog with the user, as do most expert system 
        tools, but the dialog in this case is all dynamically generated HTML.</p>
      <p>The knowledge base is composed of questions, rules and answers. An initial 
        goal starts the system searching through the rules for ones that can produce 
        an answer. The conditional parts of those rules might refer to facts whose 
        values can be obtained by asking questions of the user.</p>
      <p>Here, for example, are some questions from the knowledge base that are 
        presented to the user when the system is on the scent of the 16-bit ODBC 
        problem shown in figure 2:</p>
      <pre><font color="#000080">question('second edition', [<br></font><font color="#000080">     prompt = $Is it Second Edition or have you          <br>               installed the Y2K update?&lt;BR&gt;$, <br></font><font color="#000080">     ask =yes_no, <br></font><font color="#000080">     askAfter = ['symptom']<br></font><font color="#000080">]).</font></pre>
      <pre><font color="#000080">question('BackTrack Version', [<br></font><font color="#000080">     prompt = $What version of BackTrack are you
               running?&lt;BR&gt;$, <br></font><font color="#000080">     ask = field, <br></font><font color="#000080">     askAfter = ['symptom']<br></font><font color="#000080">]).</font></pre>
      <p>Here is a rule that might drive the asking of those two questions. If 
        the reported symptom was as indicated, then this rule is in contention 
        and the questions would be asked. Otherwise, they wouldn't be asked.</p>
      <pre><font color="#000080">if 'symptom' = 'Label Designer hangs on converting databases dialog' <br></font><font color="#000080">   and ('BackTrack Version'  &lt;=  '4.10')
   and 'second edition' = 'yes' <br>   </font><font color="#000080">and (operating_system = 'Windows 98 Second Edition'<br>   or operating_system = 'Windows 98')<br></font><font color="#000080">then problem = 'Win 98se'.</font></pre>
      <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And here 
        is the knowledge base code that generates the answer in figure 2:</span></p>
      <pre><font color="#000080">answer('Windows 98se', problem,  [ <br></font><font color="#000080">     text = [$The version of Label Matrix you have (v. 4.60 or below) <br>              is not</font><font color="#000080"> compatible under Windows 98 Second Edition or if <br>              you installed the Windows</font><font color="#000080">98 Y2K update from the Microsoft <br>              website. The reason Label Matrix is not ... </font></pre>
      <p>Here's a segment of the larger answer that would result from following 
        figure 1 to its conclusion, including HTML formatting, that helps the 
        user with smudging:</p>
      <pre><font color="#000080">answer('Ink spread', problem,  [ <br></font><font color="#000080">     text = [$There is a way to control the ink spread on Laser and<br>              Inkjet </font><font color="#000080">printers by using the following commands in the <br>              products INI file.  See </font><font color="#000080">list of products below for the <br>              appropriate INI </font><font color="#000080">filename.<br>              &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BCAddToSpaces=n&lt;BR&gt;BCAddToBars=n&lt;BR&gt;Where n is <br>              the number ...</font></pre>
      <p>The StrandWare knowledge base currently contains over 100 of the most 
        common solutions.</p>
      <h2>Additional Benefits</h2>
      <p>The statistical reports from the system give a good indication of the 
        types of problems and equipment users have, as well as indicating how 
        well the system is resolving issues. For example, the current statistics 
        indicate that the largest area of tech support questions revolve around 
        printing issues, and the second largest area around label design issues.</p>
      <p>The system also shows that technical support issues are relatively flat 
        across the customer base, with no particular customer having a larger 
        than normal number of sessions, and that Windows 98 is the most heavily 
        used operating system among the customers, and Zebra is the most popular 
        printer.</p>
      <h2>Future Directions</h2>
      <p>Based on the success of this system, StrandWare is considering two other 
        applications of expert system technology. One would be for sales advisors, 
        to help prospects pick the right products for their application. The other 
        would be an internal system that routes unresolved technical support issues 
        to the best-suited person for dealing with the issue.</p>
