        The Safety Engineering Unit <br>
        Studies Human Reliability <br>
        with the Ovenman, C++ and Amzi!</font></H2>
      Allan Boyd at the Safety Engineering Unit at the University of Aberdeen 
      is studying Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). HRA is about applying techniques 
      from human factors, cognitive science, and risk assessment in an attempt 
      to: produce reasonable assessments of when someone is likely to make a mistake, 
      discover ways of reducing the likelihood of mistakes being made, provide 
      ways to mitigate against the consequences of mistakes. At the moment the 
      research is focusing on the ovenman. The ovenman is a software simulation 
      that will compare and contrast different HRA techniques/models that are 
      currently in use throughout industry. 
      <P>The ovenman's principle task is to change uncooked cakes into correctly 
        cooked cakes. A correctly cooked cake is a cake which is not overcooked 
        or undercooked. To achieve this task the ovenman must prepare a plan of 
        oven settings that will cause the oven to turn out the current batch of 
        cakes correctly cooked. A plan is necessary because the available oven 
        settings cannot usually be made to correspond exactly to the associated 
        cooking time and cooking temperature of the cakes. An added complication 
        is provided by the variability of the cake mixtures and the ovenman's 
        'fuzzy' knowledge of the cooking times and temperatures of the cakes. 
        There are no written instructions detailing how a type of cake should 
        be cooked. The ovenman relies purely on his expert knowledge to judge 
        the appropriate oven settings and the condition of the cakes when viewed 
        through the oven inspection ports. 
      <P>The ovenman is not supposed to be a robot who does everything perfectly 
        all of the time. He is supposed to be more human and as such he is expected 
        to make mistakes. HRA techniques used in this study are designed to quantify 
        the likelihood of a mistake being made. In theory then, all that has to 
        be done to make a 'human' out of the ovenman is to apply an HRA technique 
        to the model to predict the errors he will make. In effect the HRA technique 
        dictates the behaviour (or divergence from optimum performance) of the 
        ovenman. 
      <P>The ovenroom and its contents and the main driver module are programmed 
        in C++ for its object orientedness and diversability. The ovenman is programmed 
        using Amzi! Prolog and controls the ovenman's diagnosis of the situation, 
        selection of appropriate action i.e. what to do next, and execution of 
        the action. Prolog was chosen for its built-in inference engine and Amzi! 
        because of the ease with which their Prolog can be integrated with C++ 
        and Windows.
