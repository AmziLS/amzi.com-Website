<h2 align="center"><font color="#666666">eoTek Core Systems Gain<br> Adaptability, 
Speed and Reliability<br> with the Amzi! Logic Server</font></h2><p><img src="eotek_nexstar_logo.gif" width="190" height="60" align="right" border="0">Nexstar's 
services make every aspect of home financing simple and efficient. Key to these 
services is an on-demand Web application that allows their customers, such as 
bank loan officers, to find the best mortgage for a client. This application is 
a product of Nexstar's Evergreen, Colorado subsidiary, eoTek.</p><h3>Pricing a 
Key</h3><p>Pricing is obviously the critical factor. It is also a highly variable 
factor. The pricing modules were originally implemented with about 5000 lines 
of Java code, working with associated database files. The Java code was complex 
because the dynamic interdependence of the factors and rules is difficult to express 
with a procedural language.</p><p>It worked, which was all well and good, except 
it constantly needed to be updated to reflect changing pricing factors and rules.</p><p>Each 
change in the business of mortgage pricing required programmers to tinker with 
the delicately intertwined Java code and database files. The changes were difficult 
to implement, error-prone, and involved a long quality assurance (QA) test cycle.</p><h3>More 
Adaptable Solution Needed</h3><p>Looking for an easier to maintain, less error 
prone solution, that would give them the flexibility to provide the most reliable, 
up-to-date, mortgage services, eoTek turned to the Amzi! Logic Server.</p><p>The 
factors could be expressed as logical assertions of facts; the rules as logical 
relationships between factors. The tricky procedural code that navigated a path 
through the rules could be eliminated.</p><h3>Quick Development</h3><p><IMG SRC="eotek_codesize.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="170" ALIGN="RIGHT">In 
less than <b>two months</b>, they replaced 18 database tables with files of logical 
assertions, and the 5000 lines of Java code with <b>500 lines</b> of logical relationships 
(Why so few? They eliminated all of the code relating to database access and flow 
of control between the interconnected rules.)</p><h3>High Reliability</h3><p>The 
resulting logic-base was virtually error free, having only <b>one percent</b> 
of the bugs encountered with the Java version. (Why so few errors? The coding 
of the rules as logic is much clearer, and there's simply less code to go wrong.)</p><p><IMG SRC="eotek_maintenance.gif" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="170" ALIGN="RIGHT">It 
is very easy to maintain. Facts are simply changed. Rules are simply changed. 
The pricing logic-base is tested as a modular component, and the QA cycle <b>dramatically 
shortened</b>.</p><h3>Fast Integrated Performance</h3><p>It is fast. Logic-bases 
are compiled into compact executable modules. The response time for the logic-base 
component is an insignificant portion of a transaction.</p><p>It is an integral 
part of the full application. The main Java application code uses the Amzi! Logic 
Server application program interface (LSAPI) to access the logic-base.</p><h3>Ongoing 
Development</h3><p>Based on the success of pricing, eoTek has implemented logic-base 
solutions for other critical aspects of their application. Underwriting, scheduling 
of decision-making tasks, state and local variability are all implemented as logic-bases. 
</p><h3>Success Factors</h3><p>eoTek's success comes from strong management support, 
good development and test procedures, sharp programmers, all working with Amzi!'s 
solid commercial logic-base product and excellent support and training.</p><p><a href="http://www.eotek.com"><img src="eotek_logo.gif" width="180" height="80" border="0" alt="eoTek"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
