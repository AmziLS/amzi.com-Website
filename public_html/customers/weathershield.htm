        and Pricing <br>
        Directly to Dealers and Customers <br>
        Using Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server</font></h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.weathershield.com">Weather Shield</a>, one of the 
        nation's leading window and door manufacturers, offers a comprehensive 
        line of wood windows, vinyl windows, hinged and sliding patio doors and 
        steel insulated entrance systems for the new construction and remodeling 
        markets.</p>
      <p><img src="weathershield_logo.jpg" width="150" height="140" align="right">They 
        wanted to make it easy for people to do business with Weather Shield by 
        providing a tool for dealers, contractors and other customers to be able 
        to configure the correct window/door product for a given job, to get pricing 
        for that product, and to automatically generate an order.</p>
      <p>They do this by providing a CDROM for their customers with an application 
        written in Visual Basic (VB) that provides the user interface and connectivity 
        to the Weather Shield online order entry system.</p>
      <p>The tricky part was encoding and deploying configuration and pricing 
        knowledge. These are best expressed as logical relationships and frequently 
        change with new product offerings and pricing strategies. How best to 
        get the knowledge from those who know the products and pricing into the 
        software on the customer's computer?</p>
      <p>Clearly an architecture that enabled those with the know-how to directly 
        maintain the configuration and pricing knowledge would be a huge advantage 
        over alternative solutions that required coding the knowledge directly 
        in VB.</p>
      <p>And if that knowledge was deployed in a logicbase external to VB, but 
        queried from VB, then the application could easily be updated with new 
        logicbases.</p>
      <p>For this they chose Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server. The configuration and 
        pricing knowledge is expressed directly in a Prolog logicbase, which is 
        called from the VB code during the configuration and pricing process. 
        Updates to the logicbase are performed automatically when the user connects 
        to Weather Shield's Web site.</p>
      <p>There was one problem. The configuration rules are complex and using 
        Prolog syntax directly was not a good solution for those with the know-how. 
        So the developers created a database format that the experts could use 
        to express the complex logical relationships of product configuration 
        and pricing.</p>
      <p>That database is then translated into Prolog syntax for deployment.</p>
      <p>The rules go further than just providing configuration and pricing information. 
        They also drive the VB application user interface.</p>
      <p><img src="weathershield_door.gif" width="108" height="136" border="0" align="left">The 
        developers took advantage of the ability of Prolog to callback to VB to 
        enable actions in rules that drive the VB interface. Controls representing 
        different units are displayed or not, based on the rules in the logicbase. 
        So the entire configuration process, including the evolving visual display 
        as a user works through a configuration, is driven by the Prolog logicbase.</p>
      <p>The result is the software developers concentrate on the software, the 
        product knowledge and configuration process is maintained by those in 
        the know, and the customers have up-to-date tools for generating and ordering 
        accurate product configurations.</p>
      <p>From a learning perspective, it took the developer's 2-3 weeks to get 
        enough knowledge of Prolog to begin writing prototypes for the project.</p>
      <p>From a performance perspective, they are constantly amazed by how fast 
        Prolog applies the appropriate rules during configuration.</p>
      <p>The keys to success were talented developers, management commitment, 
        and good technical support.</p>
