          Scheduling of Satellite Broadcasts</font></b></h2>
      </center>
      <p>While some corporations or organizations are in a position to utilize 
        satellite broadcasting on a full time basis, others can more effectively 
        time-share resources for the delivery of digital data, voice, and video. 
        In a time-sharing system, the usage time for a particular satellite transponder, 
        which provides a two-way communications channel, is allocated among different 
        customers. </p>
      <p>Typical applications include: 
      <ul>
        <li> Video for distance learning and corporate meetings</li>
        <li> Downloading of large data files</li>
        <li> Data provision to advertising kiosks</li>
        <li> Audio feeds for in-store advertising and private news channels</li>
        <li> Augmenting ISP backbones with an "IP multicast over-net" in which 
          web-cast feeds go directly from the Internet broadcaster to the last 
          mile ISP POP&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Understanding the need for the economical provision of these satellite 
        services, including high speed data transfer, DigitalXpress provides organizations 
        with the ability to share a single transponder for delivery throughout 
        the United States, covering all locations, including remote areas. Uplink 
        of data to the satellite is done through dial-up or dedicated lines into 
        a central site run by DigitalXpress. 
      <h3> <b>Scheduling is Key</b></h3>
      Key to implementing the services is scheduling the usage of the satellite 
      transponder among many customers. However, scheduling is a complex task 
      because there are many variables. To begin with, the information to be broadcast 
      may be stored and transmitted later (digital data) or transmitted in real-time 
      (video and audio). 
      <p align="center"><img SRC="digxpr_diagram.gif" height=353 width=440> 
      <p>The advent of streaming video further complicates scheduling because 
        streaming video cannot be interrupted. This is in contrast to data, which 
        will not lose its integrity if there is a short delay in transmission 
        since it is sent in packets instead of a stream. 
      <p>To handle the complexity of scheduling, DigitalXpress built a rule-based 
        scheduling engine that determines the best transmission time for a given 
        broadcast. 
      <h3> <b>Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server Selected for Building the Scheduling 
        Engine</b></h3>
      The scheduling engine was built using Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server, because 
      it met the requirements of: 
      <ul>
        <li> Speed for real-time scheduling</li>
        <li> Flexible because it's easily embedded in many applications&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server consists of the general purpose Prolog language, 
        delivered as the foundation of a compact, powerful library that is easily 
        embedded in a variety of applications. It works with C, C++, Java, Smalltalk, 
        Delphi, Visual Basic; has a CGI interface for Web servers; and a general 
        API for tools such as Access, PowerBuilder, and Excel. 
      <p>The Amzi! Logic Server extends Prolog to access and reason over any kind 
        of data, such as from databases or remote servers. 
      <h3> <b>Scheduling Inputs</b></h3>
      Inputs to the scheduling engine include: 
      <ul>
        <li> Requests for a specific transmission date and time</li>
        <li> Type of data to be transmitted type (store-and-forward or real-time)</li>
        <li> Duration of broadcast (in 1 or 15 minute increments)</li>
        <li> Priority</li>
        <li> Reliability factor (send once, send twice)</li>
        <li> Channel&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Store-and-forward transmissions are typically small and billed in 1-minute 
        increments. Real-time transmissions are much harder to schedule and are 
        handled in 15-minute increments. The priority is used for load leveling 
        and for controlling the level of preemption when scheduling higher priority 
        transmissions. In addition, the scheduler can schedule equipment maintenance. 
        If the maintenance is due to a pending failure, the scheduling engine 
        can immediately reschedule affected transmissions. If a new transmission 
        schedule cannot be reached, an operator is required to manually determine 
        the new schedule time for the transmission. 
      <h3> <b>Object Model</b></h3>
      The scheduling works hand-in-hand with transmission specifications that 
      are stored in an object model. This object model defines channels, configurations, 
      schedules, transmissions and business rules. Channel objects describe the 
      characteristics of channels within the satellite transponder. Configurations 
      define the transmission services that are available and the attributes of 
      the customers who purchase them. Schedule objects are the result of the 
      scheduling engine and are a commitment to provide a service at a specified 
      time/duration or window of time. Transmission objects are used to manage 
      the process of actually making the transmission (which are initiated by 
      an operator for real-time services). Business rules define operational constraints, 
      minimum and the maximum duration of specific services and other constraints. 
      <p>All of these objects are stored in a persistent database, but that layer 
        is invisible to the scheduling engine and the graphical user interfaces 
        that use the objects. 
      <p>Based on information from the object model, the scheduling engine delivers 
        a schedule of work for the Uplink center and receiver sites. The schedule 
        can be created in less than five seconds. Once the schedule has been created, 
        the transmission can be broadcast and the customer can be billed.&nbsp; 
      <h3> <b>Prolog for Flexibility</b></h3>
      The scheduling engine uses several algorithms, originally written in Visual 
      Basic, to tie in with the entire system of applications, object servers 
      and databases. 
      <p>However, DigitalXpress soon recognized that modifying the Visual Basic 
        code was expensive in both time and cost and still would not allow quick 
        response to changing market demands. DigitalXpress sought a flexible system 
        that could be easily understood by most programmers. Experience had shown 
        that trying to maintain and adapt the scheduling algorithms using Visual 
        Basic was not an effective way to go. It was not going to fit the bill. 
      <p>An expert system shell was not practical because the solution to the 
        scheduling problem could not be represented in the expert system's domain. 
        The expert shell would have been acceptable for the algorithms alone, 
        but would have been difficult to integrate with the other applications, 
        object servers and databases. 
      <p>DigitalXpress decided that a switch from Visual Basic to Amzi! Prolog 
        + Logic Server for the scheduling algorithms was the way to go. Amzi! 
        Prolog + Logic Server provided the flexibility needed for quick response 
        to changing market requirements. In fact, DigitalXpress estimates that 
        development time and effort was <b>spared by a factor of ten</b> by making 
        the switch. 
      <h3> <b>Prolog for Speed</b></h3>
      The scheduling engine works in real-time as well as in advance, and demonstrates 
      that Prolog easily delivers the speed necessary for real-time scheduling. 
      <h3> <b>Amzi! Prolog Embeddable in Visual Basic is Advantageous</b></h3>
      Additionally, DigitalXpress was impressed by Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server's 
      ease of integration with both Visual Basic and C. Amzi! Prolog is embeddable 
      in Visual Basic. Currently much of the application, including about 30 graphical 
      user interfaces (GUIs), is written in Visual Basic. These GUIs manage the 
      service definitions, customer contracts and billings, resource and channel 
      management and schedule creation and execution. The schedule creation user 
      interface interacts with the scheduling engine (in Prolog). Although DigitalXpress 
      hasn't used the C/C++ interface to extend Amzi! Prolog with new functions, 
      it is important that this flexibility is available to them in the future. 
      <p>Finally, it was critical to have support services available, which would 
        not be the case with a freeware version of Prolog.
