        TIBCO and Amzi!:<br>
        Implementing Efficient Business Rules Applications <br>
        with Prolog Scripting </font></h2>
      <a href="http://www.TIBCO.com"><img src="TIBCO_logo.jpg" width="169" height="45" align="right" border="0"></a>TIBCO 
      Software is rapidly expanding to become the leader in middleware applications. 
      It was named one of &quot;The 12 Most Influential Companies in IT&quot; 
      by CMP net's Intelligent Enterprise feature story, &quot;The Dozen 2001,&#148; 
      and is poised to become a leader in Enterprise Application Integration. 
      <p> TIBCO&#146;s premier application for the management of workflow using 
        intelligent business rules is <a href="http://www.tibco.com/products/in_concert/index.html">InConcert</a>, 
        a member of the ActiveEnterprise application suite. InConcert coordinates 
        both workflow, and human and electronic resources, through a flexible 
        and scalable graphical interface (see figure). InConcert thus allows managers 
        and team members to see and manage complex workflow patterns, thus increasing 
        efficiency and customer satisfaction, and improving team moral. </p>
      <p>But unlike traditional project management tools, InConcert is rules-based. 
        This moves workflow processing from a simple dependency check-list into 
        a robust environment that can handle the simultaneous and interleaved 
        activities found in real-world workplaces. Rules give InConcert the ability 
        to adjust the workflow on-the-fly as new problems or situations are encountered.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="TIBCO_screen.gif" width="525" height="325"></p>
      <p>A simple example using InConcert is scheduling the installation of new 
        phone service. If a telephone junction box has a maximum of five lines, 
        and a sixth line is ordered, then a new junction box must be installed 
        before the new phone service can be started. A single instance of this 
        kind of rule-based decision process may appear trivial. But, phone installations 
        have hundreds of such rules that represent a myriad of personnel and equipment 
        constraints. InConcert can reason over all those constraints for each 
        individual customer and identify which ones are applicable to that customer's 
        situation. Then, InConcert can reason over the resources available to 
        solve the problems, and plan and manage the optimum workflow to get the 
        job done. InConcert&#146;s ability to organize workflow scheduling can 
        improve both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>These workflow issues occur in any large business, whether the tasks 
        being ordered and managed are phone installations, stocktrades, or any 
        other industry specific process. InConcert is designed to have the flexibility 
        and expandability to fit into any business setting, and to work efficiently 
        for any large organization, by building and customizing applications to 
        meet the customer needs within the structure and resources of the organization.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Prolog as the Scripting Language</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>TIBCO&#146;s choice of Amzi! Prolog as a rules scripting language provides 
        much of InConcert&#146;s power, flexibility, and ease of use. Choosing 
        Prolog has also raised some eyebrows in an industry where the obvious 
        scripting choice might have seemed to be Perl or Javascript.  The three 
        basic misconceptions about the use of Prolog for business rules applications 
        were:</p>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li> That the amount of shelf space given Prolog in the average developer&#146;s 
          library was extremely small, compared to Javascript or Perl. </li>
        <li> There is a smaller number of experienced Prolog scripters (again, 
          relative to Perl or Javascript). </li>
        <li> Some lingering misunderstanding of the effectiveness of Prolog for 
          business applications, given the long association of Prolog with AI.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first two of these reservations were answered by simply introducing 
        the developers to Prolog. Since Amzi! Prolog source code can be run directly, 
        there is no compilation phase required (although it is available). And 
        Prolog is compact, easy to read with straightforward syntax. Once programmers 
        overcame the initial hurdle of Prolog&#146;s apparently unusual structure, 
        they are often amazed at how much they can accomplish without extensive 
        training or practice. New users at InConcert's training classes are typing 
        in usable business rules before the lunch break</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The third concern, that &#147;Prolog is an AI language&#148; was answered 
        because the capabilities of Prolog were an obvious match with InConcert's 
        product requirements. Prolog is a language for flexible and powerful searching 
        and pattern matching. This has led to Prolog&#146;s success in a variety 
        of rule-based business applications, which was a significant factor in 
        TIBCO&#146;s choice of Prolog for InConcert's process engine. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Other options <i>were</i> initially considered, but all were found to 
        be &#147;brittle&#148;, in the words of the project&#146;s chief developer, 
        Ed Black, &#147;When you reach the edge, you just fall off.&#148; Neither 
        other scripting languages, nor a spreadsheet approach, had the necessary 
        power or flexibility. And using Prolog as a scripting language led to 
        significantly shorter implementation time for InConcert than would have 
        been possible using a more conventional scripting choice. Even a Javascript 
        expert, on examining the problem statements for InConcert concluded that 
        &#147;&#133;Prolog was a <i>much</i> better fit&#148; for the application.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3 align="left">Choosing Amzi! Prolog</h3>
      <p>Of the various implementations of Prolog available, TIBCO chose Amzi! 
        Prolog for several reasons. Amzi! has been in business for over a decade, 
        and has an industry wide reputation for close and extremely productive 
        working relationships with clients. TIBCO&#146;s developers speak enthusiastically 
        about Amzi!&#146;s &#147;almost instantaneous support&#148;.</p>
      <p>On the technical side, Amzi! Prolog proved the best fit, both because 
        of its flexibility and its ability to be extended with functions in other 
        programming languages via Logic Server Extensions (LSX&#146;s). The Logic 
        Server Extensions allow Amzi! Prolog to be the heart of InConcert's process 
        engine. The process engine takes embedability to a new level by having 
        the LSX's (written in C++) call back to Amzi! Prolog. (So you have C++ 
        calling Prolog which in turn calls C++ which calls Prolog!) 
      <p>In addition, InConcert uses the full power of the Amzi! Logic Server 
        by having multiple servers (running under multiple threads) in its process 
        engine, each providing a different set of specialized workflow services. 
        Some of these services include enacting tasks and listening for and acting 
        on messages. The servers communicate with each other using an internal 
        messaging system. 
      <p>Another reason TIBCO selected Amzi! is its Logic Server which allows 
        Prolog modules to be embedded in many languages, for InConcert this is 
        Java and C++. Amzi! also can run on almost any platform. This gives InConcert 
        the ability to ship its product on HP/UX, Solaris, and Windows. 
      <p>For developers, the Amzi! Integrated Development Environment is, in the 
        words Ed Black, &#147;fast and flexible&#148;, allowing for &#147;very 
        rapid applications development.&#148; And Amzi! Prolog is reliable. It 
        is described by the TIBCO team as &#147;the most robust part of the application&quot;.</p>
      <h3 align="left"> Prolog for Business Rules Scripting</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>TIBCO&#146;s choice of Prolog was, as described above, a leap in thinking 
        about Enterprise Application Integration. Prolog was not the usual choice, 
        or the obvious one. But InConcert has proved the usefulness, value and 
        speed of Prolog in the development of business rules applications. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This is good news for TIBCO&#146;s clients, who are able to purchase 
        fast, flexible, and robust software, which can be adapted to a wide range 
        of industries and companies. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And this is good news for the Prolog community, offering more evidence 
        of the flexibility and power of Prolog, the logical and quickly learned 
        scripting language for business.</p>
