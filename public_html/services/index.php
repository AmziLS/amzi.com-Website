      Amzi! provides consulting services in the following areas. Contact <a href="../company/contact_form.php">us</a> 
      with your specific needs. 
      <dl> <DT><I><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Logic-base Prototypes</B></FONT></I></DT><DD> 
We can build a prototype of a logic-base that fits your knowledge structure and 
reasoning processes.</DD><DT>&nbsp;</DT><DT><FONT SIZE=+1><B><I></I></B></FONT></DT><DT><I><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Reasoning 
Engines</B></FONT></I></DT><DD> We can build a reasoning (inference) engine to 
meet your specific needs in Prolog, Java, C++, VB.NET, C#.NET, or Delphi; including 
tools for authoring and testing knowledgebases, extracting rules from spreadsheets, 
databases or other formats and maintaining the knowledge for sharing amoung groups 
of people.<br>
        </DD>
        <DT>&nbsp;</DT><DT><FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Intelligent 
Applications</I></B></FONT></DT><DD> We can design and build client-server, object-oriented 
applications that fill a variety of needs. Our areas of expertise include Java, 
JSP, .NET, ASP.NET, C++, Visual Basic, Delphi, OODBMS and more under Windows, 
Solaris, HP/UX, Linux and OpenVMS.&nbsp; For example, we have built a 3-tier Java 
application supporting knowledge harvesting work for medical research.</DD><DT>&nbsp;</DT><DT><FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Intelligent 
Web Components</I></B></FONT></DT><DD> We can design and build intelligent components 
for the web. These components can be based on KnowledgeWright, the Amzi! Logic 
Server or other intelligent technologies. They can be deployed as Servlets, JSP, 
ASP.NET or CGI applications. For example, we have built a Breast Cancer Decision 
Guide for the U.S. Government.</DD></dl><dl> <dt><font size=+1><b><i>Private-Labeled 
Development Environments</i></b></font></dt><dd> We can put your product or company 
name on the Amzi! IDE or KnowledgeWright Workshop so you can distribute a full, 
GUI development environment for your users to create and/or modify Prolog logic-bases 
and KnowledgeWright knowledgebases. </dd></dl><dl> <DT><FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Porting 
to New Operating Systems</I></B></FONT></DT><DD> We can port Amzi! Prolog + Logic 
Server and KnowledgeWright to almost any operating environment. In the past we 
have ported to 64-bit OpenVMS, OSF/1, BSDI and, more recently, HP/UX. As the runtime 
is quite compact, we can port Amzi! to any device with a C/C++ compiler, including 
Unix boxes, mainframes, handhelds and virtual machines (such as Java and .NET). 
</DD></dl><dl> <DT><FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Product Enhancements </I></B></FONT></DT><DD> 
We can add custom enhancements to Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server and KnowledgeWright 
to meet your specific needs. These can be added into the product or built as custom 
extensions (LSXs). </DD></dl><dl> <dt><font size=+1><b><i>Prolog Training</i></b></font></dt><dd> 
We offer a one-week course in Prolog development that can be customized to your 
application and programming environment. We can also provide application-level 
guidance by telephone on a retainer basis or on-site for any number of days.</dd><dt>&nbsp;
