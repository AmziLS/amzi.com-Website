<h2><a name="arulesxl" id="arulesxl"></a>ARulesXL 2.0 Pre-Release</h2>
<p>The 2.0 version of ARulesXL is now ready for downloading.</p>
<p>In addition to all the features introduced in the previous beta releases, 2.0 
  includes two major additions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new, much more powerful, trace facility, and</li>
  <li>A new runtime that allows you to run rule sets on Web Servers and in VB, C#, Java, Delphi and Extend applications. </li>
</ul>
<h3>New Trace</h3>
<p>The new Trace makes use of an Excel worksheet to display the state of execution 
  of a rule query. It is controlled by it's own menu bar and lets for easy examination 
  of the original rules and the trace. You can trace into rules or skip the details.</p>
<p>Trace is excellent for both debugging ARulesXL applications and for learning 
  how a business rule engine works.</p>
<p>Here's a screen shot from the middle of a trace from the sample <i>Loan Approval</i>.</p>

<p> The new Trace is documented in both the Tutorial and the Reference documentation.</p>
<h3>New Runtime</h3>
<p>The ARulesXL runtime lets you export rule sets to a file and then query them 
  from Web Servers, stand-alone applications and Extend models. Interfaces are 
  provided for VB, C#, Java and Delphi. There is a complete manual on the API 
  (Application Program Interface), and samples for many languages and environments. 
  If you need an interface for another language or tool, please contact us.</p>
<p>The runtime makes ARulesXL a powerful development tool for back-end knowledge 
  bases. For example, the <a href="../vaclogic/index.htm">VacLogic</a> application 
  is developed and maintained using the ARulesXL Excel development environment, 
  but is deployed as a component in a Delphi application for running pediatric 
  offices.</p>
<p>The runtime is part of the new Professional Edition of ARulesXL.</p>
<h3>Download &amp; Buy</h3>
<p>The Standard Edition remains at its special introductory price of $99 per user. The Professional Edition is priced at $899 per   user, and includes 10 runtime licenses. Both Editions include the first year's maintenance so you can install all new releases for the next 12 months.</p>
