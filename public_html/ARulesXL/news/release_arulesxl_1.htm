to Your Excel Spreadsheets <!-- #EndEditable --></h2><!-- #BeginEditable "Contents" --> 
<p>December 16, 2005 - Asheville, NC - Amzi! announces ARulesXL&#8482;, a new add-in for Microsoft&#8482; Excel&reg; that integrates decision support with computational analysis. This makes it possible to solve a wider variety of problems with spreadsheets including budget analysis, product configuration, workflow, advice,  planning and pricing. </p>
<p>Rules in ARulesXL are easier to code, less costly to maintain, more reliable, and, most importantly readily audited. Instead of difficult to read  IF functions, rules are entered directly on the spreadsheet in a natural and   easy to understand syntax. The rules are queried, much like a database. User inputs can be gathered from cells or forms and the results can be displayed in reports or tables.</p>
<p>The ARulesXL syntax is designed to model business rules for pricing, configuration, underwriting, approvals, benefits, workflow, advice and similar applications. The rule syntax is compatible with Excel and VBA, providing seamless integration between non-procedural, pattern matching rules and procedural spreadsheet calculations. Data is easily shared between rules and cells. ARulesXL supports multiple rule sets with objects, properties and inheritance to facilitate decomposition of complex applications. It also provides facilities for dynamic document assembly which is ideal for legal and government regulations applications. </p>
<p>ARulesXL makes it easy to write and maintain rules and provides its own menu of operations including a full rule debugger that illustrates the dynamic pattern matching that underlies rule execution.  The next release will include the ability to export rules for use in web-based applications.</p>
<p>A major accounting firm is one of the first commercial users of ARulesXL and   is using the product for developing equity compensation analysis tools. Visual   Data LLC, vendor of Office Practicum&trade; pediatric office software, is using   ARulesXL for the development and testing of rules used in vaccination   planning. ARulesXL is ideal for Sarbanes Oxley compliant spreadsheets with easy to read   and audit business rules that generate or verify results. </p>
<p>Additional information and a free 30-day evaluation is available from www.arulesxl.com. ARulesXL has an introductory price of $99 per copy, and includes product maintenance and support for one year. Quantity discounts are available for large sites.  </p>
