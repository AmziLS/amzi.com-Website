<h2><a name="arulesxl" id="arulesxl"></a>ARulesXL Quick Tour </h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An ARulesXL rule set is a collection 
  of facts, decision tables, rules, formulas and logical relations that are used 
to determine the values of output properties based on input properties.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arulesxl.com/whitepapers/quick_tour/inputs_rules_output.gif" width="484" height="304"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, here is a rule set name 
  RateTable with a simple decision table to determine the price of a phone call 
  based on whether the call was made on a weekend and during the day. The property 
  .price is the output and the properties .weekend and .daytime are the inputs.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arulesxl.com/whitepapers/quick_tour/price_rules_0.gif" width="642" height="250"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rule set is queried very much 
  like a database using the function RQuery(). In the function window above you 
  can see the query that asks to find the value of .rate. It also sets the input 
  properties, .weekend and .daytime to the values in cells C5 and C6. RQuery() 
  returns the value of .rate derived from the decision table in the rule set named 
  RateTable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to input and output properties, 
  a rule set can have intermediate properties that are used in determine the value 
  of output properties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suppose we wanted the inputs to be 
  the day of the week, the time of day and the duration of the call. And we wanted 
  the rule set to determine the price of the call. And finally, the rate is not 
  fixed, but a multiple of a single base rate. The new specifications are:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Price is duration * rate</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A weekend is Saturday, Sunday, 
    and Friday after 8:00PM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Daytime is between the hours of 
    8:00AM and 6:00PM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rates of calls are based on 
    a single base rate, which is 4 cents.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The output property will now be .price. 
  The output property is also called a goal of the rule set.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arulesxl.com/whitepapers/quick_tour/price_rules_1.gif" width="675" height="570"></p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How it works</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The decision tables, rules, facts 
  and formulas are entered in any order in the rule set, much as data is entered 
  in a database. A rule engine is used to determine the output property value 
  from the inputs. It will dynamically choose the rules and table entries necessary 
  for producing the answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The output property becomes a goal 
  of the rule engine. If that property depends on other properties, those properties 
  become sub-goals of the rule engine. Each of those might require further sub-goals 
  until the input properties are reached. Here are the sub-goals used in the example 
  query.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arulesxl.com/whitepapers/quick_tour/sub_goals.gif" width="866" height="290"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because this is generated dynamically 
  by the rule engine, the rule set developer does not have to worry about flow 
  of control. Simply enter the decision tables and rules and pose the queries 
  they can answer.</font></p>
