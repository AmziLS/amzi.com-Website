  <font size="+1">A Case Study of a Commercial ARulesXL Application</font> </h2>
<p>VacLogic III is a sophisticated ARulesXL application that analyzes vaccination   histories, determines the current status of each vaccine, and plans for the   optimal next dose, if necessary. With hundreds of rules modularized in 36 rule   sets, it is designed to handle the many complexities of vaccinations including   combination vaccines, incorrect sequencing, too early/late administration and   much more. VacLogic III contains much of the same knowledge as a prior version   implemented using logic programming, but because it is now coded using ARulesXL   the rules are much easier to read, to verify as correct, and to maintain. </p>
<p>The expressive power of  VacLogic was  demonstrated at <a href="http://www.medrecinst.com/conference/tepr/index.asp"> TEPR 2005 and 2006 </a> (Towards Electronic Patient Records) medical conference competitions for pediatric office management software.  Office Practicum, which uses VacLogic, won the 2005 competition, was a close   second in 2006 and for both years was the only package that correctly identified   faults in a vaccination series involving complex multi-antigen combination   vaccinations.</p>
<p>VacLogic uses Excel for development, maintenance and testing.  VBA code is used to create a user interface that allows the integration of external patient database records and the ARulesXL knowledge base. It also includes a full regression testing capability. The ARulesXL export feature is used to deploy the VacLogic knowledge base in <a href="http://www.visualdatallc.com">Office Practicum</a>, which is written using Delphi.  The ARulesXL application program interface allows the export to be used in other environments as well, such as Java and .NET. </p>
