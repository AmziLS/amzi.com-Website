<h1>Amzi! Interactive Fiction Toolkit</h1>
<p>The Amzi! Interactive Fiction Toolkit (AIFT) provides a framework for capitalizing 
  on the expressiveness of executable logic in implementing interactive fiction 
  (IF) games.</p>

    which discusses IF issues and a logicbase approach to the development of IF.</li>

<p>Discussions of Sample Games:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="cloak_of_darkness.htm">Cloak of Darkness</a> - The classic small 
    IF game used to compare authoring tools. </li>
  <li><a href="duck_world.htm">Duck World</a> - A small game designed to illustrate 
    various features of AIFT.</li>
</ul>
<p>AIFT can be used as is with a text editor to create new IF games, but a Prolog 
  development environment will provide better tools for authoring and debugging.</p>
<p>AIFT was implemented using Amzi! Prolog and Logic Server (<a href="http://www.amzi.com">www.amzi.com</a>), 
  but can be easily used with any ISO standard Prolog.</p>
<p>AIFT is a work in progress, and its current state is best described as beta.
