            <h2><a name="from_the_editor"></a>Welcome to the Premier Issue</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <i>Dr. Dobb's AI Expert Newsletter</i>. Before you begin 
              to talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI), you have to deal with 
              the name itself. It leads to impassioned philosophical debates, 
              like those raging right now on the <a href=http://www.ddj.com/DDJForums/forum.jsp?forum=40>AI 
              Forum</a>, and inspires some great science fiction. (The Hyperion 
              Trilogy by Dan Simmons is my favorite, based on Tom Ray's fascinating 
              <a href=http://www.isd.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/index.html>Tierra</a> 
              project, but that's for a later newsletter.)</p>
            <p>Debates on machine vs. human intelligence are fun, but this newsletter 
              needs a working definition of AI that more realistically encompasses 
              the wide variety of fascinating software and hardware usually classified 
              as AI. So we'll define it in terms of computer nature rather than 
              human nature:</p>
            <p><i><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the art and science of making 
              computers do interesting things that are not in their nature.</b></i></p>
            <p>What is a computer's nature? Well it has memory that's good for 
              storing data and a CPU that processes sequences of instructions. 
              If you have a problem that requires automating data storage, procedures 
              or both i.e. data processing, then computers are perfect. Other 
              types of problems are trickier.</p>
            <p>Consider <a href=http://smi-web.stanford.edu/projects/history.html#MYCIN>Mycin</a>, 
              one of the earliest AI programs. The developers were posed with 
              the problem of trying to automate medical diagnostic knowledge that 
              was best expressed as rules.</p>
            <p>The rules were neither data or procedures. Trying to force them 
              as either was untenable for any significant body of knowledge. So 
              what could they do?</p>
            <p>The answer lies in the words of some long forgotten hardware engineer:</p>
            <p> <i><b>&quot;Software is a kludge for getting around design flaws 
              in the hardware.&quot; </b> </i> </p>
            <p>What the Mycin developers really needed was a new kind of computer: 
              one that processed rules. So they created a virtual machine, they 
              called it an inference engine, whose nature was ideal for processing 
              knowledge expressed as diagnostic rules.</p>
            <p>People in the AI field have been doing the same thing ever since, 
              creating virtual machines that are programmed in non-conventional 
              ways, and using those machines to perform previously untenable programming 
              tasks.</p>
            <p>Which leads to the problem with an AI newsletter. There isn't a 
              common language, like Java or C++ that is used for AI applications, 
              nor are there standards like SQL for database access, or HTML for 
              Web browsers.</p>
            <p>Nor are these virtual machines similar. The classic ones deal with 
              a wide variety of rule languages and reasoning algorithms, while 
              others deal with semantic networks, neural networks, ontological 
              knowledgebases, genetic algorithms, artificial life, robot brains, 
              cellular automata and, of course, games.</p>
            <p>And then, given a specific area of AI one can write about how to 
              build the tool, or write about applications of the tool. The former 
              is solid programmer stuff; the latter requires some knowledge of 
              the specific tool, which is often a commercial product.</p>
            <p>So I'm asking for your input. There is a wealth of fascinating 
              subject matter that this newsletter can cover, and I'd like to know 
              what your interests and experiences are. Send me e-mail. Tell me 
              what you're currently doing with AI and what you'd like to see covered 
              in the AI Expert Newsletter. I want the newsletter to meet your 
              interests.</p>

            <h2><a name="news"></a>News</h2>
            <h3><a name="chess"></a>It's a Tie!</h3>
            <p><a href=http://www.brainsinbahrain.com/>Brains in Bahrain</a> was 
              the latest man-machine chess showdown of champions, pitting Kramik 
              (a human) against Deep Fritz (a software program). Kramik won the 
              early matches in what was called a triumph of anti-computer strategy. 
              Deep Fritz won the later matches in what was called a triumph of 
              anti-human strategy.</p>
            <p>Chess playing has often been considered an ultimate test of machine 
              intelligence because it is too complex to be mastered using straight-forward 
              search algorithms. That is, the search space of possible moves is 
              too great to be explored by a machine.</p>
            <p>Early researchers worked on encoding the essence of grandmaster 
              reasoning to improve performance. They learned, for example, that 
              grandmasters had greater &quot;pattern vocabularies&quot; than weaker 
              players. They didn't reason faster than weaker players, but more 
              efficiently because they were reasoning using larger chunks of knowledge.</p>
            <p>With the speed of today's machines, the value of the brute-force 
              search in chess had become more important. Its ironic that in this 
              classic test of machine intelligence, computers are playing on a 
              par with the best humans more by exploiting the natural strengths 
              of computers, and less by the application of human-like intelligence. 
              Intelligent or not, today's top chess programs are masterpieces 
              of software engineering.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that Deep Fritz is not <a href=http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/>Deep 
              Blue</a>, which was dismantled after defeating Kasparov in the last 
              man-machine chess championship. Deep Blue was an amazing mix of 
              specialized parallel processing hardware and software capable of 
              searching 200 million moves per second. Deep Fritz is a souped up 
              commercial product from <a href=http://www.chessbase.com/>ChessBase</a> 
              running on stock hardware capable of only 3 million moves per second. 
              They claim it's smarter though.</p>
            <p>As for humans, with their feeble CPUs, they still provide stiff 
              competition for millions-of-moves-per-second machines. It all appears 
              to revolve around superior recognition and processing of patterns. 
              And when you take a heavily pattern-oriented game like <a href=http://www.hiroshima-pu.ac.jp/~sasaki/cgf/index.html>go</a>, 
              well computers aren't even close, yet.</p>
            <h3><a name="duck"></a>1738 Artificial Duck</h3>
            <p>Dr. Jessica Risken of Standord University has done a <a href=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/report/news/october24/riskinprofile-1024.html>study 
              of a mechanical duck</a> built in 1738 that created the same interest 
              and excitement as current experiments in artificial life. The parallels 
              between their desire to use mechanized models to understand real 
              life, and ours, are fascinating.</p>
            <p>Among other things, the duck was realistic in that it ate and pooped. 
              But if you looked inside, it sort of cheated. Food went in, and 
              time passed, and poop came out, but the input food was still there, 
              and the poop had been pre-loaded. So the duck didn't really digest, 
              it just looked like it did.</p>
            <p>That is not dissimilar from the chess programs that look like they 
              understand the patterns on the board, but instead are processing 
              millions of individual moves.</p>
            <p>But also like the chess programs, the duck was an amazing bit of 
              engineering and probably a lot of fun to build.</p>

            <p>AI Expert Magazine, this newsletter's namesake and inspiration, 
              was one of the premier magazines covering AI in the early 1990s. 
              Considering the quality of the magazine, it probably comes as no 
              surprise that we can still learn from many of the articles published 
              a decade or more ago. To that end, every month we'll be publishing 
              an article or two from AI Expert on Dr. Dobb's Journal's <a href="http://www.ddj.com/topics/ai/">AI
