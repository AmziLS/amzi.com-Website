            <p>One reader asked if Prolog was psychic and could tell that Price 
              and PriceCents were the same in this example. Unfortunately psychic 
              versions are only available at advanced wizardry research institutions. 
              Normal programmers have to spell all their variables the same.</p>
            <pre>
price(StartHour, DurationMinutes, PriceCents) :-
   StartHour < 7,
   StartHour > 16,
   Price is Duration * 10.
</pre>
            <p>(The error has been fixed in the archive version, plus the additional 
              error that 8pm is 20:00 not 16:00. ed)</p>
            <p>Sigh. I shouldn't edit the code for clarity when it's in the newsletter. 
              I think I introduced a bug into the previous month's Bayesian example 
              the same way. From now on all code will be cut and pasted directly 
              from working programs and NOT editted again. I promise.</p>
            <p>Also there was interest in the Rubik's cube program. <a href="http://www.amzi.com/articles/rubik.htm">http://www.amzi.com/articles/rubik.htm</a> 
              is a link to a reprint of a PCAI article describing it.</p>
            <p>As the article describes, the program is NOT a learning program. 
              It has the strategy for solving the cube hard coded in the program. 
              So it is an interesting example of knowledge engineering, not learning.</p>
            <p>I believe there are learning versions of Rubik's Cube programs 
              around, which an Internet search might turn up. Although, they might 
              only work for 2x2 cubes.</p>
            <h2><a name="ontologies"></a>Ontologies</h2>
            <p>Early on AI researchers realized that a big problem with building 
              &quot;intelligent&quot; systems was that computers lacked common 
              sense knowledge of the world.</p>
            <p>Consider, for example, trying to write a natural language understanding 
              program with these two sentences:</p>
            <p><i>It was a canary. The beak was injured.</i></p>
            <p>It's one thing to be able to parse the words, but quite another 
              to &quot;understand&quot; what it means. A human makes use of the 
              knowledge that 1) a canary is a type of bird, and that 2) a beak 
              is a part of a bird to understand this sentence.</p>
            <p>So, in order to write a computer program that can understand those 
              sentences, it is not enough to know grammar rules and parts of speach, 
              it is also necessary to somehow encode the knowledge that a canary 
              is a bird and a beak is a part of a bird.</p>
            <p>This, in computer science terms, is an ontology.</p>
            <p>One could argue that this is a poor word choice. If you look up 
              ontology in the dictionary it talks about the philosophy of existence. 
              Which makes software ontologies sound like something very heavy 
              indeed.</p>
            <p>But they're not. A software ontology is simply encoded knowledge 
              about concepts and relationships. Like</p>
            <pre>canary is_a bird.
beak is_part_of bird.</pre>
            <p>Often times an expert system has two parts. One is an ontology, 
              describing the terminology of the domain; and the other is rules 
              that are used to reason over that domain.</p>
            <p>For example, a technical support system might have these rules 
              to let a user know which way to tilt slashes in a directory path:</p>
            <pre>If error = bad_path and directory_separator \= os_directory_separator then 
  tilt_slashes.
If operating_system = windows then os_directory_separator = backslash.
If operating_system = unix then os_directory_separator = forwardslash.</pre>
            <p>And be supported by this ontology:</p>
            <pre>windows is_a operating_system.
unix is_a operating_system.
W2K is_a windows.
XP is_a windows.
W98 is_a windows.
Linux is_a unix.
Solaris is_a unix.</pre>
            <p>Using the rules and ontology together, a tech support system could 
              then have a dialog like this:</p>
            <pre>What error? bad_path
What directory_separator? forwardslash
What operating_system? W98
Recommendation: tilt_slashes</pre>
            <p>It is the ontology that lets the rules act as if they understand 
              that W98 is a windows operating system.</p>
            <h2><a name="common_sense"></a>Common Sense</h2>
            <p>We can see where an application might have use for a specific ontology, 
              but some AI researchers are working in larger areas of discourse. 
              They want to develop software that can understand any written discourse.</p>
            <p>To do that, they needed to develop an ontology of everything.</p>
            <p>This is a huge undertaking, and one of the giants of early AI work, 
              Doug Lenat, set out to do exactly that. He and his colleagues have 
              been working on the <a href="#cyc">Cyc</a>, from encyclopedia, project 
              since 1987.</p>
            <p>Cyc is huge repository of facts (1,000,000) about the world, such 
              as trees usually grow outdoors and glasses should be held rightside-up. 
              Interfaces are available for querying Cyc, so it's common sense 
              language can be utilized in any application.</p>
            <p>There are other efforts in similar veins. <a href="#thoughttreasure">ThoughtTreasure</a> 
              in one with some interesting concepts of space connected by worm 
              holes that can be used to understand discourse about, say going 
              from the street into a restaurant. Using it as a tool, one could 
              create an ontology about spaces, such as stores on a street, or 
              a village, or a city, and understand discourse about those spaces.</p>
            <p><a href="#wordnet">WordNet</a> might be called a dictionary/thesauraus++. 
              A dictionary contains definitions, and a thesauraus contains relationships 
              of a certain kind. WordNet expands on these concepts and stores 
              many more types of relationships between words, inspired by psycho-linguistic 
              studies of how humans store and retrieve words and meanings.</p>
            <p>The WordNet documentation is full of words like meronym (part of 
              relationships), holonym (the opposite of parts), and hyponym (hierarchical 
              organization). Some of these are further subdivided. Meronyms come 
              in different flavors, being components (branch/tree), members (tree/forest), 
              and composites (airplane/aluminum). These examples are just some 
              of the relationships for nouns. Verbs, adjectives and adverbs have 
              their own similarly complex collection of relationships.</p>
            <p>WordNet lets a program understand about the canary and its injured 
              beak.</p>
            <p><a href="#edr">EDR</a> is a similar project from Japan, with the 
              added wrinkle that it has both Japanese and English lexical concepts 
              that can be used for more accurate machine translation of documents.</p>

            <p><a href="#link_georeference">GeoReference</a> is a company that 
              has applied ontology technology to mineral exploration. They provide 
              one product designed for mapping and geologic ontologies, LegendBurster,

            <p>The power of the ontology component is it allows field geologists 
              to enter information about a location in a manner that can then 
              be analyzed and understood by computer software. Without those ontological 
              definitions of geologic concepts, the data could not be effectively 
              analyzed.</p>
