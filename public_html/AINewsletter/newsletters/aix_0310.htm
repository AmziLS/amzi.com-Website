            <h2><a name="robocup"></a>RoboCup News</h2>
            <p>The RoboCup-2003 competitions were held in Padua Italy in July. 
              There were a number of levels of competition, from simulation, with 
              no real robots, up to humanoid. Humanoid robots just compete at 
              penalty kicks and the like at this point.</p>
            <p>Each year the rules of the competitions are upgraded to reflect 
              the improved capabilities of the robot competitors, so I suspect 
              the rules for humanoid robots will gradually evolve to the stated 
              RoboCup goal of fielding a robotic team that can beat a human one.</p>
            <p>The smaller robots are playing real soccer. The links below include 
              some video clips that show them in action.</p>
            <p>One of the smaller leagues is called the Small-Sized League. It's 
              robots are coffee-can size and play on a surface about the size 
              of ping pong table, using an orange golf ball. The robots are autonomous 
              but radio controlled from computers, and global vision is shared 
              among them, provided by cameras mounted above the playing field.</p>
            <p>This year Cornell's Big Red team won, defeating the University 
              of Queensland Australia's RoboRoos by a score of 1-0 in overtime. 
              Given that Cornell had won a few years previous with a score of 
              10-0 and then 7-6, before losing a year, it appears that defenses 
              are getting much better.</p>
            <p>Cornell provides some of the best documentation I've found on robotic 
              soccer, and sure enough, the design goals for the 2003 team included 
              improved defense. They had special goalie programming introduced 
              this year, and had modifications to the dribbling mechanisms that 
              made it easier for their robots to strip the ball from opposing 
              robots.</p>
            <p>Cornell assembles a team of students and faculty at the beginning 
              of each academic year, with the goal of fielding a better team in 
              the Summer's competition. The team starts, like any good athletic 
              team, by studying last year's game films.</p>
            <p>Cornell's project goals provide a good insight into the state of 
              the art. Some of the things they wanted to improve in 2003 were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> setup times,</li>
              <li>maintenance of down robots,</li>
              <li>onboard sensing to prevent missed passes,</li>
              <li>better defense through strategy,</li>
              <li>more accurate kicking and dribbling,</li>
              <li>easier manufacturability,</li>
              <li>adaptive game learning,</li>
              <li>use of a goalie,</li>
              <li>keep sources of funding going.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note the emphasis on defense in this year's designm, explaining 
              the low scoring results.</p>
            <p>The Cornell project was divided into modular components. For example 
              there was a group working on mechanical design, and that group was 
              subdivided into a group working on the drive mechanism, the dribbling 
              subsystem, and the kicking subsystem.</p>
            <p>This means there were people working all year on just coming up 
              with a better kicking mechanism for a coffed-can sized robot. They 
              did, last years kicking arm warped on off center kicks, costing 
              them accuracy.</p>
            <p>The dribbling mechanism of Cornell's robots was accredited with 
              being a major factor in previous year's victories. This year they 
              were working on better control, pass reception, and the ability 
              to steal the ball from opponents.</p>
            <p>This was all done within a budget of $30,000 from corporate and 
              alumni sponsors.</p>
            <h2><a name="ai_law"></a>AI and the Law</h2>
            <p>It is tempting to look at applying AI to the law, using computer 
              programs to determine points of law and thus avoiding some of the 
              costs of human decision making.</p>
            <p>Law is represented as rules, which seems to imply a rule-based 
              technology; and as cases, which seems to imply a case-based reasoning 
              technology. And reasoning is used deduce conclusions from the rules 
              and cases, which seems to imply some sort of logic or theorem proving 
              technology.</p>
            <p>Research and experimental systems have been built using each of 
              these, and the discussion on whether or not they are practical always 
              revolves around the issues of fuzziness in the law. Michael Aikenhead's 
              paper has some interesting thoughts on rule-base and case-based 
              implementations of AI legal systems, and suggests they are limited.</p>
            <p>As a point of criticism of rule-based systems, he uses this example 
              of a law: <i>no vehicles allowed in the park</i>.</p>
            <p>The problem, he notes, is what's a vehicle? Is a bicycle allowed? 
              or a police car? While he argues the problem is difficult, it seems 
              that this is just the sort of problem that an ontology could solve.</p>
            <p>Looking through the titles of papers in the International Association 
              for AI and Law, it appears that is exactly one of the hot areas 
              of research. Mark Lauritsen's article goes into details on a law 
              ontology, refining concepts such as &quot;concept maps&quot;, which 
              seem exactly what is needed to answer the question of what is a 
              vehicle.</p>
            <p>Michael Aikenhead also goes on to discuss the potential for argumentative 
              systems. Robert Kowalski shows how to use logic programming for 
              a theorem proving approach to computerizing law.</p>
