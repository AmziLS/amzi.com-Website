            <h2><a name="machines_think"></a>Can Machines Think?</h2>
            <h3><a name="turing_test"></a>Turing Test</h3>
            <p>In 1950 Alan Turing published <i><a href="#links">Computing Machinary 
              and Intelligence</a></i> in the quarterly journal, Mind. Thanks 
              to the Internet, its now easy to read this original article that 
              is still to this day one of the defining works in AI. It is a great 
              read.</p>
            <p>In it he asked the question &quot;Can machines think?&quot;. And 
              he proposed a simple test. If a human conversed, via keyboard, with 
              a machine and with a human, and could not tell which was which, 
              then that machine could be called &quot;intelligent&quot;. This 
              is the famous <b>Turing Test</b>.</p>
            <p>Over 50 years later, intelligent people are still debating whether 
              or not the Turing Test has anything to do with machine intelligence 
              or not.</p>
            <h3><a name="loebner_prize"></a>Loebner Prize</h3>
            <p>In 1990 <a href="#links">Hugh Loebner</a> offered $100,000 and 
              a neat gold medal to the first person to write a computer program 
              that passed the Turing Test. There is an annual competition at which 
              various software authors compete for the prize.</p>
            <p>A panel of judges carry on dialogs with a number of humans and 
              machines. They then rate each on a scale from most machine like 
              to most human like. The machine with the highest score wins the 
              competition. If its score is competitive with the scores received 
              by the humans, then the authors claim the medal and the money. If 
              not, they get $2,000 and everyone tries again next year.</p>
            <p>So far, the prize has not been claimed. Some claim it can't be 
              done without the giant ontologies of common sense discussed last 
              month; others claim it requires perfecting natural language understanding; 
              and still others say a learning program is needed. But the best 
              entries so far have been based on a very simple idea.</p>
            <h2><a name="machines_converse"></a>Can Machines Converse?</h2>
            <h3><a name="eliza"></a>ELIZA</h3>
            <p>In 1966 Joseph Weizenbaum described his program <a href="#links">ELIZA</a>. 
              It was a very simple pattern-matching program that generated realistic 
              responses to its input. It was designed to mimic a psychiatrist. 
              (Weizenbaum, Joseph &#147;ELIZA&#151;A Computer Program for the 
              Study of Natural Language Communication between Man and Machine,&#148; 
              Communications of the ACM, Vol. 9. No. 1 (January 1966))</p>
            <p>For example, here's one of the ELIZA rules from one implementation 
              of ELIZA. (See the <a href="#links">links</a> for source code in 
              a number of languages.)</p>
            <pre>rules([[dream,3],[
   [1,[_],0,
   [what,does,that,dream,suggest,to,you,?],
   [do,you,dream,often,?],
   [what,persons,appear,in,your,dreams,?],
   [do,you,believe,that,dreaming,has,something,to,do,with,your,problem,?],
   [newkey]]]]).
 </pre>
            <p>If the input had the word 'dream' in it, this rule would generate 
              the response, using one of the four choices. It doesn't matter what 
              the rest of the input was.</p>
            <p>Think about this a second. These are pretty much the kinds of responses 
              one would get in a conversation when bringing up a dream.</p>
            <p>Another powerful idea in ELIZA was pronoun swapping. In the input, 
              all first person pronouns became second person and visa versa. So 
              an input like &quot;I remember Alaska&quot; would match the patterns 
              in this rule (The 'Y' in the rules is a wild card.):</p>
            <pre>rules([[remember,5],[
   [1,[_,you,remember,Y],0,
   [do,you,often,think,of,Y,?],
   [does,thinking,of,Y,bring,anything,else,to,mind,?],
   [what,else,do,you,remember,?],
   [why,do,you,remember,Y,just,now,?],
   [what,in,the,present,situation,reminds,you,of,Y,?],
   [what,is,the,connection,between,me,and,Y,?]],
   [2,[_,do,i,remember,Y],0,
   [did,you,think,'I',would,forget,Y,?],
   [why,do,you,think,i,should,recall,Y,now,?],
   [what,about,Y,?],
   [equal,[what,0]],
   [you,mentioned,Y,.]],
   [3,[_],0,
   [newkey]]]]).
 </pre>
            <p>And generate a response like &quot;Do you often think of Alaska?&quot;.</p>
            <p>Weizenbaum was horrified at how many people enjoyed chatting with 
              ELIZA and that fact that even some therapists thought ELIZA was 
              a useful therapeautic tool. He wrote ELIZA in part to prove that 
              machines can NOT think. Yet people were interacting with the program 
              as if it could.</p>
            <p>But who do you enjoy talking to the most? Isn't it the person who 
              listens, and ask questions prompting you to go on and on about yourself? 
              ELIZA just follows the user's lead, letting him/her talk about whatever 
              he/she wants. What more could someone want in a conversationalist? 
              What more does a therapist do?<br>
            </p>
            <h2><a name="people_think"></a>Can People Think?</h2>
            <p><a href="#links">Richard Wallace,</a> one of the developers of 
              A.L.I.C.E., which won the Loebner competition (not the prize, just 
              the most human-like of the machine contestants), observes that the 
              majority of casual human dialog is really just simple pattern-matching 
              response. He notes that people aren't really paying attention to 
              each other and just spitting back responses based on what's on their 
              mind and maybe a trigger or two from what they just heard.</p>
            <p>The disturbing part of the debate on ELIZA is not whether it is 
              intelligent or not. Clearly it's not.</p>
            <p>The disturbing question is whether ELIZA is human-like or not. 
              Clearly it is.</p>
            <h2><a name="chat_bots"></a>Chat Bots</h2>
            <p>ELIZA was fun, and prompted all sorts of derivitive works, generically 
              called chat bots.</p>
            <h3><a name="alice"></a>A.L.I.C.E.</h3>
            <p> A.L.I.C.E. won the Loebner prize twice. It's really just a more 
              sophisticated version of ELIZA with a much larger set of patterns. 
              The development of the patterns is made easy by a standardized AI 
              Markup Language (AIML) that is a well-formed XML. AIML can be used 
              by anyone to create any sort of chat bot.</p>
            <p>Here's some of the AIML from the winning version of A.L.I.C.E.</p>
            <pre> &lt;category&gt;
   &lt;pattern&gt;HOW AM I SUPPOSED *&lt;/pattern&gt;
   &lt;template&gt;
   &lt;random&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Carefully.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Think about it.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Don't just give up.&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;/category&gt;
 </pre>
            <p>This, of course, fits the definition of AI used in this newsletter, 
              which is the creation of a virtual machine to run programs written 
              in a language well suited for a particular domain. In this case 
              AIML is a perfect language for creating chat bots and an AIML runtime 
              makes it go.</p>
            <h3><a name="mgonz"></a>MGonz</h3>
            <p>Maybe its not significant, but I thought it was funny. Mark Humphry 
              wrote a chat bot to stand in his place when he was away from his 
              computer. Here's some rules from it that are triggered by the keyword 
              'Mark' in the input:</p>
            <pre> ( (member 'mark input)
   (delve '(
   (mark isnt here and hes left me to deal with
   cretins like you)
   (forget mark i will destroy him like the others)
   (mark doesnt want to talk to you fishface
   why do you think im here)
   (listen leave that jerk out of it talk to me)

            <p>That scene from 2001 brilliantly captures all our fears of AI, 
              the horror of unfeeling machines empowered to run our lives.</p>
            <p>I recently installed anti-spam software and was experiencing the 
              very human emotion of frustration trying to get the software to 
              work. I'd clearly done something simple wrong, but couldn't figure 
              out what. So I contacted tech support.</p>
            <p>It was a Web site. The FAQ didn't have the answer. But they recommended 
              Chat with a technical support person. Sounded good, so I tried it:</p>
            <p>Technical Support Chat: You have been connected to Sean Bourke.<br>
              Sean Bourke (S): Dennis, thank you for contacting McAfee<br>
              S: How can I assist you today?<br>
              Me (D): I just installed spam killer and don't seem to be able to 
              get it to work.<br>
              S: Are you receiving any error message?<br>
              D: No, I got it to work once, but it didn't filter anything.<br>
              I ran it over night, and it didn't find anything, yet when I ran<br>
              Eudora, I had tons of spam, like usual.<br>
              S: Dennis, if I understand correctly, you have the SpamKiller not 
              filtering<br>
              mesages. Is this correct?<br>
              D: That is almost right. It found one message a little while ago. 
              The <br>
              blue arrow in on now<br>
              S: I would be happy to assist you with that.<br>
              D: OK, so give me a starting point. Is your name ELIZA?<br>
              S: No.<br>
              S: What is the version of SpamKiller that is installed on the system?<br>
              D: I just installed it from your Web site yesterday, so its the 
              latest<br>
              version.<br>
              ...<br>
              S: Based on the information you have provided, I can now provide 
              the<br>
              steps that should resolve your issue. If at any time there is something<br>
              you do not understand, will you please stop me and let me know?<br>
              D: You didn't just type that did you? There's something non-human 
              on<br>
              your end.<br>
              S: No, I am a real person here.<br>
              D: You sound like ELIZA, give me some slang to prove you're human.<br>
              S: I am going to send you some instructions that will open a new 
              window.<br>
              D: I'm reading them now, but I also do an AI newsletter and would 
              like<br>
              to write about you<br>
              S: Okay<br>
              (I followed the instructions, still didn't work)<br>
              D: I've been pretty frustrated, if we can't get it going I'd like 
              to know<br>
              how to get a refund.<br>
              S: Could you please tell me the country you are in?<br>
              D: USA<br>
              S: This issue or concern is supported by our Customer Service group. 
              You<br>
              may call 1-972-963-8000, select the option that best meets your 
              needs, and they will be<br>
              able to assist you.<br>
              D: What is wrong with my installation of Spam Killer?<br>
              S: Nothing is wrong. You will just need to follow a few steps to 
              configure the spamkiller<br>
              using the instructions that I sent you.<br>
              D: But I did that! It doesn't work.</p>
            <p>(Called phone number, just recorded menu items, referring me back 
              to<br>
              Web page that gives me the option of this chat again or paying $39 
              to talk<br>
              to someone.)</p>
            <p>Well, the instructions were just how to re-install, which of course 
              didn't work and subsequent passes through the same loop gave the 
              same answer, so I did the logical thing and threw my mouse across 
              the room and made a note not to get another radio controlled mouse.<br>
