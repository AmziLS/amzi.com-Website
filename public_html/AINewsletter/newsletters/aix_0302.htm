            <h2><a name="robocup"></a>Robotic Soccer</h2>
            <p>The Robocup goal:<i> By the year 2050, develop a team of fully 
              autonomous humanoid robots <br>
              that can win against the human world soccer champion team.</i></p>
            <p>While computers are winning at chess, the Robocup organizers are 
              looking to win at soccer. So far the robots are just playing each 
              other, but the events are getting huge. Last year's event in Fukuoka-Busan 
              drew 188 teams from 29 countries.</p>
            <p>There are a variety of competitions, including small, mid-sized, 
              four-legged and human. The small competitions have five robots on 
              a team and can use wireless communication with an off-the-field 
              computer for control. The mid-sized and four-legged competitions 
              require each robot to carry all of its hardware with it.</p>
            <p>They also have a simulation league, which is RoboCup without the 
              actual robots, running in a simulator instead.</p>
            <p>From Sony's 'old' Web site: &quot;In order for a robot team to 
              actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated 
              including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, 
              strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robotics, and sensor-fusion. 
              RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under 
              a dynamic environment.&quot;</p>
            <p>So, not just a robot doing a task, but a team of robots working 
              together. One of the teams was proudly proclaiming that they were 
              the first to successfully pass the ball in competition. A lot of 
              the research is going to figuring out the opponent. Vision and learning 
              together are a key technology, with the idea being to figure out 
              and learn an opponent's behavior so as to best out play it.</p>
            <p>A Google search on RoboCup reveals the scope of the international 
              research going into the event. Universities from all over the World 
              have Web sites describing their robot teams, technology and research.</p>
            <p>With all this activity, it seems likely they might reach their 
              goal. See the <a href="#links_robocup">links</a> for more details.</p>
            <h2><a name="companies"></a>AI Companies</h2>
            <p>Here are some more stories of small companies, using AI in specific 
              product niches.</p>
            <h3><a name="evolution_robotics"></a>Evolution Robotics</h3>
            <p>Evolution Robotics provides consumer robotics kits for the home 
              hacker. Their ER1 has gotten a lot of favorable press coverage lately 
              as a hobby robot. They provide the mechanical framework, the sensors 
              and the software, and you provide the laptop. They have recently 
              announced the ER2.</p>
            <p>They also provide their technologies to other companies interested 
              in developing commercial robots. These technologies include the 
              Evolution Robotics Software Platform (ERSP) and modules that support 
              robot vision recognition, mapping and navigation, and human-robot 
              communication.</p>
            <p>Their origins are more entrepreneurial than other companies we 
              have covered. Their founder is Bill Gross who is also CEO of Idealab. 
              Idealab is a management umbrella that operates a number of high 
              tech companies, providing business and marketing expertise to those 
              companies.</p>

              and <a href="http://www.idealab.com">http://www.idealab.com</a></p>
            <h3><a name="irobot"></a>iRobot</h3>
            <p>iRobot is a start up made of people from, and in charge of, the 
              MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. It's been in business for 10 years, 
              with the goal of producing robots that are commercially viable. 
              Their products range from toys, to household appliances, to robots 
              for the military.</p>
            <p>Roomba is a robot vacuum cleaner that you can purchase through 
              Brookstone for $199. There is a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/roomba-users/join">Yahoo 
              discussion group</a> of Roomba users, and other than complaints 
              of the length of battery charge, they all seem pretty happy.</p>
            <p>For the military, they have PackBot. PackBots saw action in Afghanistan, 
              doing the dangerous work of exploring caves in the region. The military 
              would rather risk robots than soldiers for this sort of work. I 
              wonder if that will be the case in the world of <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=7730/ddj0301ai/0301ai001.html#spiritual_machines">Kurzweil's 
              visions</a>?</p>

            <h3><a name="friartuck"></a>FriarTuck</h3>
            <p>FriarTuck is a startup in Singapore focusing on scheduling applications. 
              Martin Henz, one of the principals in the company, was involved 
              in the design and development of the Mozart constraint-based programming 
              language, mentioned in previous newsletters. Not surprisingly, FriarTuck 
              uses Mozart to implement their scheduling systems for health care, 
              education and sports organizations.</p>
            <p>Singapore provides excellent support for start up companies, and 
              FriarTuck received its initial funding in the form of awards from 
              business plan competitions. Their first customers are in the Singapore 
              area, but they're outlook is global. Given the impressive results 
              they have produced with the ACC basketball <a href="#links_scheduling">schedule</a> 
              demo, it seems they have a lot of potential.</p>
            <p>See <a href="http://www.friartuck.net">www.friartuck.net</a> for 
              further information. (<a href="http://www.friartuck.com">www.friartuck.com</a> 
              looks like a very nice resort in New York's Catskill mountains.)</p>
            <h2><a name="basketball"></a>Basketball Scheduling Continued</h2>
            <p>Readers of last month's newsletter article about <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=7730/ddj0301ai/0301ai001.html#genetic_scheduling">basketball 
              scheduling</a>, pointed me to additional work on the Atlantic Coast 
              Conference (ACC) basketball scheduling problem. It seems it has 
              become somewhat of a benchmark after publication of George Nemhauser's 
              and Michael Trick's article on using integer programming and enumeration 
              to find a better, quicker solution than we did. Theirs still took 
              24 hours, but it was able to search the entire solution space, something 
              we were not able to achieve.</p>
            <p>ILOG, a company offering constraint technology tools, and FriarTuck 
              both have implemented versions of the ACC scheduling program as 
              marketing demonstrations.</p>
            <p>FriarTuck is implemented using Mozart, which has popped up before 
              in the newsletter. The most fascinating aspect of their solution 
              is they claim to be able to search the entire solution space in 
              less than a minute. Wow.</p>
            <p>One of the main reasons for the speed of the constraint based approaches 
              is simply a better algorithm for tackling the problem. Instead of 
              looking directly for a schedule that works, they break the problem 
              into three phases. This has the tremendous benefit of allowing follow 
              on phases to not waste time evaluating constraints that were incorporated 
              in generating earlier phase results.</p>
            <p>The first phase searches for acceptable patterns of home and away 
              games, without regard to any other constraints, or individual teams. 
              Once those patterns are found, they are enumerated and a universe 
              of possible schedule patterns emerges. Those patterns are then filled 
              in with generic team place holders, searching for possible generic 
              time tables. The time tables are then filled in with actual team 
              constraints in the search for final workable schedules.</p>
            <p>See the <a href="#links_scheduling">links</a> for the various articles, 
              as well as Michael Trick's summary page of all sorts of sports scheduling 
              services and products. The articles contain additional references 
              to a host of other sports scheduling research.</p>

            <p><b>Mining for Financial Knowledge with CBR</b> [Feb 1994]- Paul 
              Buta of Dun and Bradstreet describes the use of case-based reasoning 
              (CBR) to mine knowledge from financial data. The article has excellent 
              coverage of both the problem domain and the primary issue with CBR 
              systems, which is determining the relevant 'cases' are and how best

              for the multi-year process a putting a shuttle in orbit. The system 
              uses rules, objects and scheduling algorithms to capture the expertise 
              of the shuttle planning experts. It's an excellent case study of 
              applying a variety of AI and programming technologies towards the

              strategic and tactical aspects in the search for a summit, they 
              address the problems mentioned in a previous newsletter about the
