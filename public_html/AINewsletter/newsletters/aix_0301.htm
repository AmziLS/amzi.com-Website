            <h2><a name="deploying_ai"></a>Business Models for Deploying AI</h2>
            <p>There is no doubt of the benefit of various AI tools and techniques, 
              but, compared to conventional applications, there are additional 
              costs associated with using AI. In other words, deploying AI requires 
              a cost/benefit analysis just like everything else. </p>
            <p>The major cost is acquiring the people with the necessary skills. 
              AI techniques are not that difficult to learn and use, but they 
              are different and take some time to learn and master. The benefits 
              of a potential AI application must outweigh the costs of dedicating 
              the people and training time necessary to get the job done right.</p>
            <p>Last month's newsletter covered two models of favorable cost/benefit 
              analysis for deploying AI. Both involved large organizations with 
              1) the financial resources to invest in people with AI skills, and 
              2) a significant body of potential applications that made the investment 
              worthwhile. One was a large corporation, American Express, that 
              developed staff for internal development; the other was the Egyptian 
              Department of Agriculture, which used a cooperative effort between 
              government, academia and commercial agriculture.</p>
            <p>This month covers a third cost/benefit model that does not require 
              large financial resources, but instead requires individuals willing 
              to take a risk in the free market. It is the small company using 
              AI to gain a competitive advantage in narrow application markets.</p>
            <p>In these cases, the company's investment in AI will hopefully be 
              compensated for by multiple customers of that company's products 
              and services.</p>
            <p>The key to success for this model is knowing how to market the 
              products. Typically, however, this is not that big a problem, as 
              the entrepreneurs involved understand the problems of the market 
              because of personal experience.</p>
            <p>That is the case for the three examples which follow: a company 
              that knows the education market providing classroom scheduling; 
              individuals with experience in pharmaceutical research providing 
              data mining tools and services; and developers of sophisticated 
              military simulations moving into computer game software.</p>
            <p>These three examples came from following threads of interest from 
              readers, so keep those e-mails coming.</p>
            <h3><a name="class_scheduling"></a>Classroom Scheduling</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.antinoos.gr/en">Antinoos</a> is a Greek company 
              with a handful of application products targeted at specific applications. 
              <a href="http://www.antinoos.gr/en/orologio.htm">Orologio</a> is 
              their school time table application. Scheduling applications, such 
              as school time tables, are notoriously difficult (see <a href="#links_scheduling">scheduling 
              link</a>). Antinoos has implemented their own probabilistic weighted 
              search scheduling algorithm in the application, developed using 
              Borland's Delphi 3.</p>
            <p>Antinoos and Orologio provide a perfect example of how a small, 
              technically-oriented company can make an investment in AI technology 
              and apply it to applications for users that have no interest in 
              how the application actually works. (&quot;People want holes, not 
              drills.&quot; -- Black and Decker)</p>
            <p>This model is more applicable today than ever, due to the Internet's 
              phenomenal potential to reach Global markets.</p>
            <p>In the words of Haris Saravanos of Antinoos: &quot;There are so 
              many fields to use AI and create software for real business, but 
              so little time. Of course, for some years markets (U.S. Market excluded) 
              were unable to follow. Thanks, basically to Internet, things have 
              changed. Nowadays we're in process of selling OROLOGIO in markets 
              such as BOTSWANA's !! Greek software (or any kind of product) in 
              Botswana was out of the question a couple of years ago.&quot;<br>
            </p>
            <h3><a name="data_mining"></a>Pharmaceutical, Biotech Data Mining</h3>
            <p>Pharmaceutical and biotech companies produce tremendous amounts 
              of experimental data. <a href="http://www.scinovaindia.com/">SciNova 
              Informatics</a> is an Indian company that specializes in data mining 
              products and services that provide researchers with clearer insights 
              into that data.<br>
            </p>
            <p>They use a variety of techniques, including automatic rule induction, 
              neural networks and genetic algorithms. They provide both consulting 
              services and a commercial product, <a href="http://www.scinovaindia.com/products.html">Prometheus</a>.</p>
            <p>Like Antinoos, they started their initial work with hospitals and 
              companies in India. They are branching out to Europe and the U.S. 
              Their product lines are developed in conjunction with their consulting 
              work.<br>
            </p>
            <h3><a name="game_simulations"></a>Game Simulations</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.stottlerhenke.com">Stottle Henke Associates</a> 
              is a growing company offering, among other products, tools for creating 
              intelligent agents in virtual world computer games. In their case 
              the products are a result of extensive contract work they did generating 
              intelligent tutors and training simulators for the military.</p>
            <p>Like SciNova, their company provides both consulting/contract services 
              and products related to those services.</p>
            <p>The gaming product is called SimBionic(TM). The product fits this 
              newsletter's general model of AI. There is an engine that implements 
              the agents, and a graphical development environment that lets game 
              developers easily create the agents and their behaviors. The graphical 
              development environment lets subject matter experts directly program 
              the behaviors without an intermediate programmer. The engine is 
              written in C++ with an API that let's it be easily integrated into 
              a larger gaming context.</p>
            <h2><a name="spiritual_machines"></a>Spiritual Machines</h2>
            <p>If you haven't already read <i>The Age of Spiritual Machines</i>, 
              by Ray Kurzweil, I highly recommend it. I won't guarantee that you'll 
              like the book, although you might, but I will guarantee that it 
              will make you think. His thought-provoking prophecies of digital 
              circuitry eventually replacing human brains has triggered many different 
              responses, many of which are posted on <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net">Kurzweil's 
              site</a>.</p>
            <p>Kurzweil has a tremendous resume of success. He got his start following 
              the entrepreneurial business model. He used his inventive genius 
              to create optical character recognition and speech synthesis tools, 
              and then his marketing genius to understand and reach the blind 
              market with his reading machine for the blind. This led to meeting 
              Stevie Wonder, which led to music synthesizers, which led to... 
              Well that whole story is in the book as well.</p>
            <p>Without even looking to the future, his accounts of what is happening 
              in the present are fascinating, and well documented with extensive 
              references. And he lays out a blueprint on how to build a brain 
              today.</p>
            <p>It's simple. Just combine recursive problem solving with evolutionary 
              algorithms that optimize neural net topologies.</p>
            <p>Interesting. That's kind of what the developers of programs to 
              play the game of go are doing.</p>
            <h2><a name="computer_go"></a>Go and Computers</h2>
            <p>Go is considered by many who have played it to be the ultimate 
              board game. It has fascinated players for centuries, yet today it 
              has an added charm. The best computer go programs are only at beginner 
              levels. One can feel smug playing a game that artificial intelligence 
              cannot, at least for now, play.</p>
            <p>Why is that? It's not for lack of trying. There is an ongoing assault 
              of very talented go players and programmers trying to create better 
              and better go programs.</p>
            <p>One reason is simply the size of the board. It's played on a 19x19 
              grid so there are more moves to consider, which means standard alpha-beta 
              search algorithms have much more work to do.</p>
            <p>But that's not the main reason. It's very difficult to assess how 
              good a move is. In fact, it is extremely difficult to simply write 
              a program that correctly determines the score at the end of a game, 
              a feat easily carried out by human go players.</p>
            <p>How is that evaluation done? It's a pure and simple human brain 
              pattern-matching exercise. The complex interrelated patterns of 
              white and black stones hold the key to understanding the game.</p>
            <p>Which is all kind of ironic. Chess programs started out looking 
              to emulate human pattern matching, and instead evolved into muscular 
              search programs that overwhelm human intelligence. Go programs are 
              going the other way. Search simply doesn't work, and developers 
              are looking to emulate human pattern matching, as Kurzweil describes.</p>
            <p>When a computer finally does start playing reasonable go, it will 
              be doing so in a more human-like way than its chess playing cousins.</p>
            <p>See the <a href="#go">links</a> for information about computer 
              go.</p>
            <h2><a name="genetic_scheduling"></a>Basketball Scheduling Experiences</h2>
            <p>A number of years ago I was contacted by the Atlantic Coast Conference 
              (ACC), one of the top collegiate athletic conferences in the U.S., 
              with the problem of generating a &quot;fair&quot; basketball schedule. 
              It appears that college basketball, in the top conferences, is a 
              particularly difficult scheduling problem, due to a very compact 
              season and the desire of each team to not yield any competitive 
              scheduling advantage to other teams, like having less home games 
              on weekends and therefor fewer games with the advantage of a boisterous 
              partisan crowd.</p>
            <p>I was told that a scheduling expert had told them the constraints 
              were impossible to satisfy, which had the effect of making it somewhat 
              of an obsession for me.</p>
            <p>We did come up with a good schedule for the ACC that year, and 
              have since done other work for other conferences. The Big East Conference 
              men's basketball schedule is considered the most difficult, due 
              to complex arena constraints that other conferences don't have. 
              The individual responsible for the schedules is an avid chess player 
              who spends months manipulating tokens representing teams and games. 
              The ACC told the Big East about our program, but the Big East was 
              skeptical. So just like in the old folk song about John Henry competing 
              with the steel-driving machine, it became a head-to-head competition. 
              Well, I think it was a tie, but they liked the hand developed schedule 
              better.</p>
            <p>We still schedule the Big East women's basketball each year, which 
              doesn't have the arena constraints. But we've never truly gotten 
              a program that we like, so we keep changing it.</p>
            <p>The first version of the program, written in Prolog, used a pure 
              depth-first search, and produced great schedules when the constraints 
              were solvable, after considerable searching. The order of the initial 
              list of games to be scheduled had a tremendous affect on the program's 
              success or failure. Given the wrong start, the program never converged, 
              but with a good start it might converge relatively quickly. This 
              immediately led to the &quot;I'd rather be lucky than good&quot; 
              rule that shuffled the input list and restarted the program after 
              it had run too long.</p>
            <p>It also suggested genetic algorithms as an approach. The next version 
              of the program was a pure Java genetic scheduling algorithm. It 
              had the advantage of generating poor, but playable, schedules early 
              on and then gradually evolving better and better schedules. It worked, 
              and was less nerve-racking than the first version, but it never 
              found the really great schedules the first version did. And it also 
              took a long time.</p>
            <p>The problem with genetic algorithms is that, despite a really cool 
              name, they are just hill-climbing algorithms. They incrementally 
              move a little higher in the evaluation function's space each time. 
              And like all hill-climbing algorithms, they might be going up a 
              minor summit, rather than Everest. And it appears the search space 
              of the basketball schedule is a very rugged irregular terrain. Again, 
              luck in the start turned out to be key.</p>
            <p>Which makes one wonder about Kurzweil's vision. He has one sentence 
              in his book, where he notes that you need to have a good random 
              sample of starting points for evolutionary algorithms to work. Is 
              evolution really such a great means of finding solutions? Doesn't 
              it really just find some local summit near the starting point and 
              sit there?</p>
            <p>And what does this mean about human intelligence? Are we evolving 
              up some minor peak? Might not the reptiles have done better than 
              us mammalian types if they hadn't gotten in the way of a big meteor?</p>
            <p>Back to this human intelligence wrestling with basketball schedules. 
              The latest and current version uses a combination of Prolog search 
              with C++ classes representing individual team schedules. The C++ 
              code can quickly generate evaluation functions scoring each team's 
              schedule. That score becomes the single constraint driving the search. 
              Recursion repeats the scheduling process by using the last best 
              score as the single constraint for each succeeding schedule. And 
              it still shuffles the input stream each time looking for a bit of 
              luck.</p>
            <p>It works better than the first two programs, but still takes a 
              long time. I haven't yet tried using any of the constraint-based 
              languages or tools. Maybe this year I'll have time to try out Mozart, 
              which has built-in constraint handling, and a classroom scheduling 
              sample.</p>

            <p>AI and Locomotion: Horse Kinematics [Jan 94 pg 18] - Patti Koenig 
              and George Bekey describe a University of Southern California research 
              project that lets a rider sit on a mock horse and control a virtual 
              horse for the complex gaits of dressage. Neural nets are used to 
              transmit the riders inputs to the horses movements, but unfortunately 
              aren't described in much detail. However the complexity of dressage, 
              which I never understood, is explained as well as the overall architecture 
              of the project.</p>
            <p>Gravitating Towards Common Sense [Feb 94 pg 9] - Lance Elliot discusses 
              the advantages of including strategic metarules in a rule based 
              system. The metarules determine the best reasoning strategy the 
              system should use, based on the particular case being processed. 
              Given that different problem domains have both different specific 
              rules and different ways of strategically approaching a problem, 
              understanding a domain's metarules is often the key to successful 
              deployment of a rule based system.</p>
            <p>Using Neural Nets to Manage Investments [Feb 94 pg 16] - Dean Barr 
              and Ganesh Mani describe the use of neural nets for forecasting 
              financial markets. This is an excellent introduction to the basic 
              problems and approaches used. The article also discusses ways to 
              deal with the major shortcoming of neural nets, which is their inability 
              to &quot;explain&quot; themselves. Sensitivity analysis is used 
              to determine the effects of various input parameters; rules are 
              then generated based on that analysis. Good stuff.</p>
