            <h2><a name="is_ai_practical"></a>Is AI Practical?</h2>
            <p>Thanks for the e-mail.</p>
            <p>A number of people asked if AI was practical and if there were 
              commercial applications.</p>
            <p>The very fact that the question needs to be asked, and that there 
              are those who see the need to catalog affirmative answers, indicates 
              that there is some question. I haven't seen anyone ask if there 
              were commercial applications of databases, or Java.</p>
            <p>So, are there commercial applications of AI? Yes. Are there as 
              many as those in the field would like to see? No.</p>
            <p>Why not? I believe it has to do with the fundamental premise of 
              this newsletter, that AI is NOT in a computer's nature.</p>
            <p>Java was a tremendous success with programmers because it was both 
              new and familiar. It was familiar because it was based on the well-understood 
              CPU and memory of computer. It was new because of easier semantics 
              and syntax than previous languages. In short, it was a better tool 
              for the familiar job of programming.</p>
            <p>An AI tool is based on a virtual machine that does NOT work like 
              a normal computer. In order to get competent with a given tool, 
              a programmer has to learn the language of the tool AND the way the 
              underlying virtual machine works. Further, the language of the tool 
              is more difficult to learn because it is, in essence, programming 
              an unfamiliar type of machine.</p>
            <p>In other words, it's simply harder to get started with an AI tool. 
              Which means there is more inertia to overcome in getting a commercial 
              information technology (IT) shop to implement an AI-based solution 
              to a particular problem. Given the vast application backlog of most 
              shops, it's just human nature to tackle the familiar problems first.</p>
            <p>However, if a problem is pressing enough, and AI is the best solution, 
              then there is motivation to overcome that inertia. Consider for 
              example, all the stock brokers in the World using <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/proj/neuron/neural/products/">neural 
              net applications</a> (I hope that link still works) to predict stock 
              prices.</p>
            <p>Two of my favorite motivations of early adapters came from Frito 
              Lay and Lazy Boy. Frito Lay wanted fewer broken potato chips in 
              their bags; Lazy Boy wanted more efficient distribution and shipping 
              of recliners. They both achieved their goals with Rete-based production 
              planning systems. Something to think about when you relax with a 
              bag of chips watching the next Super Bowl.</p>
            <p>And how did expert systems first get out of the laboratory and 
              into commercial use? It was insurance companies screaming for a 
              way to automate underwriting. They brought IBM and a bunch of entrepreneurs 
              into the rule-based business in a hurry.</p>
            <p>Each month I'll try to cover some practical/commercial AI application, 
              so if you have any favorite ones, please let me know. This month, 
              its Egyptian Cucumbers. </p>
            <p>As always, any and all feedback is appreciated.</p>

            <h2><a name="evolving_machine_intelligence"></a>Evolving Machine Intelligence</h2>
            <p><i>&quot;Everything we know about life is based on one example 
              of life: Life on Earth. Everything we know about intelligence is 
              based on one example of intelligence: Human intelligence. This limited 
              experience burdens us with preconceptions and limits our imaginations.&quot;</i> 
              -- Tom Ray in his <a href="http://www.isd.atr.co.jp/~ray/pubs/kurzweil/index.html">critique 
              of Kurzweil's book</a> &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machine.&quot;</p>
            <p>One of the things I found fascinating about the Hyperion Trilogy 
              was the concept of the &quot;AIs,&quot; intelligences that evolved 
              in the information networks of the future. Not AIs built by humans 
              to human design specifications, but rather AIs that evolved in the 
              primordial digital soup of a vast information network.</p>
            <p>Tom Ray's work on evolving machine intelligence was the basis for 
              that bit of science fiction. What is refreshingly different about 
              Ray's work is how he tries to escape from anthropomorphic thinking 
              about artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>It is his claim that biological intelligent beings were produced 
              by evolution, and the best way to create silicon intelligent beings 
              is the same. To this end he developed the first Tierra program. 
              It had a mechanism to let programs evolve, but there was no &quot;artificial&quot; 
              human motivation, like searching for food, that drove the evolution. 
              Rather, these were just programs trying to reproduce themselves, 
              competing for CPU cycles and memory.</p>
            <p>In other words, Ray's work goes exactly opposite the working definition 
              of AI for this newsletter. Rather than building a virtual machine 
              antithetical to a computer's nature, he was seeking to evolve intelligence 
              totally within the realm of &quot;data&quot; and &quot;processing.&quot;</p>
            <p>Of course, he had to write a virtual machine to do it.</p>
            <p>His virtual machine had a machine language designed to support 
              evolutionary change, and an original program that made replicas 
              of itself in memory. But mutation would enter into the replicas 
              from time to time. The result was replicating programs evolved that 
              were much smaller and faster than the original. Also parasitic programs 
              evolved that used code from other programs, and hostile and friendly 
              programs.</p>
            <p>Wow.</p>
            <p>But his programs never got much beyond that, and he figured the 
              problem was the limitation of a single machine. This led rise to 
              Network Tierra, whereby the unused cycles of all the machines on 
              the Internet could be used to house a &quot;game preserve&quot; 
              where digital creatures were free to evolve.</p>
            <p>Tom Ray's work is an excellent example of what can happen when 
              disciplines cross. He is not a programmer. He is a zoologist. And 
              his interest in evolving intelligence in a digital medium was motivated 
              to a large degree in the possibility of creating a laboratory where 
              the mechanism of evolution could be better studied.</p>
            <p>Based on his latest writings, it appears as if the Network Tierra 
              has slowed due to technical difficulties. His creatures were consuming 
              too much band width. Ray has also moved his focus to some other 
              evolutionary software projects that more closely model organic evolution. 
              These have yielded some very visually pleasing pictures and movies, 
              but that's for a later newsletter.</p>
            <h2><a name="egyptian_cucumbers"></a>Egyptian Cucumbers, Citrus Fruit 
              and Cherry Tomatoes</h2>
            <p>The question of commercial applications of AI might be a peculiarly 
              American one, with its dramatic separation of government, academic 
              and private institutions. The three sectors work closer in other 
              parts of the World.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://potato.claes.sci.eg/claes.htm">Central Laboratory 
              for Agricultural Expert Systems</a> (CLAES) was established by the 
              Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture to optimize the use of agricultural 
              resources and maximize food production. The director of the laboratory 
              is Dr. Ahmed Rafea, who is also chair of the computer science department 
              of Cairo University.</p>
            <p>They have fielded a number of systems that seek to optimize production 
              of crops such as cucumbers, citrus fruits and cherry tomatoes, as 
              well as other agricultural related expert systems. These systems 
              are in different states of deployment, some working in the field, 
              others still in research states.</p>
            <p>Probably because of the tight relationship between government funding, 
              academia and commercial application, CLAES has had the ability to 
              develop their own set of specialized tools for agricultural expert 
              systems.</p>
            <p>These tools were developed to support the <a href="http://www.sics.se/ktm/projects/kads.html">KADS</a> 
              development methodology for expert systems. KADS is the result of 
              an a European Esprit-II research project that provides a framework 
              for thinking about and implementing knowledge-based solutions.</p>
            <p>The tools illustrate the wide range of options available for building 
              tools. Their primary expert system shell is KROL, A Knowledge Representation 
              Object Language, that was built on top of the logic programming 
              language, <a href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/%7Ekris/prolog-course/">Prolog</a>. 
              They have a case base reasoning (CBR) tool written using a relatively 
              new high order language, <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/">Mozart</a>, 
              and they have KSR, a Knowledge Sharing and Reuse tool, implemented 
              in C++. (See expert system links below to access post script documentation 
              on KROL and KSR.)</p>
            <p>The choices of tools for building tools makes sense. Prolog and 
              Mozart are both higher level languages with abstractions that make 
              it easy to model different types of knowledge representations and 
              the reasoning engines that deal with that knowledge. They are good 
              tools for building expert system and case-based tools.</p>
            <p>Their KSR system is more of a library and editing utility, something 
              that fits well within the more conventional programming capabilities 
              of C++.</p>
            <p>Thus we see in CLAES the two aspects of AI: the development of 
              virtual machines for a particular task; and the application of those 
              virtual machines to a particular problem domain.</p>
            <p>Organizationally, the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture has leveraged 
              CLAES's expertise and tools for a dozen or so applications. Given 
              the tremendous potential for spreading agricultural knowledge using 
              expert systems, the investment in team and tool building has paid 
              off for them.</p>
            <h2><a name="request_line"></a>Request Line</h2>
            <p>A few readers asked about connectionism and neural nets. I've included 
              some links on these topics below and will hopefully cover the topics 
              more in later newsletters.</p>
            <p>Another reader was interested in high performance workflow expert 
              systems in network applications. As always, there are two issues, 
              the tool and using the tool. For this type of application a tool 
              is needed that can represent the workflow knowledge, and meet the 
              performance constraints of the application.</p>
            <p>In this case I see three tool choices based on the performance 
              constraints: 1) pure compiled Prolog rules (as opposed to something 
              layered on top of Prolog); 2) a Rete algorithm-based production 
              system (efficient rule indexing); or 3) a custom knowledge representation 
              and reasoning system written in C++ and tailored to the application.</p>
            <p>Given the need for a user-friendly front-end for knowledge engineering, 
              a hybrid approach probably makes the most sense. A front-end designed 
              for expressive, easily-maintained knowledge development and maintenance 
              could compile into a back end form suitable for high performance 
              execution.</p>
            <p>For example, user friendly rules could be compiled to either pure 
              Prolog or <a href="http://www.ghg.net/clips/CLIPS.html">CLIPS</a> 
              (Rete network production rules) rules.</p>
            <p>One commercial site I have worked with provides their users with 
              a spread sheet for expressing pricing and business rules for the 
              mortgage loan industry. The spread sheet rules are then translated, 
              based on application area, to either Prolog or <a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/">JESS</a> 
              (CLIPS in Java).</p>
            <p>What decides whether Prolog or JESS is used? Prolog is used for 
              the more formally precise rules, such as pricing rules. JESS is 
              used for more subjective business rules. </p>
            <p>I welcome any thoughts or experiences from readers on this application.</p>

              this site, it had long lists of commercial applications in each 
              area, but as I write this, most of those pages are under construction, 
              although commercial neural networks were alive and well. Oh well,
