<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The diagrams that were supposed to appear in the last two month's newsletters 
  didn't display on most people's systems. The newsletters are archived at an 
  alternate site, <a href="www.ainewsletter.com">www.ainewsletter.com</a>, that 
  has copies of the issues with the pictures.</p>
<p>This month's newsletter has some further applications of the fuzzy logic system 
  developed in the February newsletter. Contact me to get the the latest version 
  of the fuzzy logic system and the full source for this month's examples.</p>

<h2><a name="emergence"></a>Emergent Behavior</h2>
<p>Emergent behavior refers to evolution-inspired computing algorithms that can 
  be used to search for desired results. Here's some interesting work in the field.</p>
<h3>Evolutionary Design and Lego(tm) Blocks</h3>
<p>Pablo Funes of Brandeis University has done a lot of work in the area of evolutionary 
  design. As part of his research he has built experimental systems that evolve 
  structures of Lego(tm) blocks that meet various design goals.</p>
<p>The Lego(tm) blocks are an excellent experimental domain because they are modular 
  units that are constrained almost entirely by the number of join points between 
  two blocks. The model of the blocks then is a model of the joints, and how much 
  stress a joint between two blocks can stand.</p>
<p>The evolutionary algorithm starts with a single brick and a design goal. The 
  design goal might specify a height and a weight. In other words the expected 
  result would be a table of sufficient size and support to hold the weight. The 
  goal might also specify a position, so the result might be a cantilevered bridge.</p>
<p>The algorithm starts by adding a random brick to the starting brick and creating 
  a number of test structures. The best are kept, the worst thrown out, and then 
  each is further evolved. Standard genetic algorithms are used as the good structures 
  are &quot;mated&quot; with parts of each going into offspring, with mutation 
  appearing periodically to start new possibilities.</p>
<p>What's fun about this work is they could then build the resulting structures 
  with real Legos(tm) to see if they worked. The thesis contains a number of pictures 
  of these evolved structures. See <a href="#links">links</a>.</p>
<p>The Lego(tm) designer shows up in Brandeis' Dynamical &amp; Evolutionary Machine 
  Organization (DEMO) project and can be seen following the fun&amp;games and 
  EvoCAD links on that Web site (<a href="#links">links</a>). This is an interactive 
  Java applet that lets you hand manipulate two-dimensional blocks and/or specify 
  design goals and let the evolutionary algorithm finish the design.</p>
<h3>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)</h3>
<p>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a search algorithm inspired by the intelligence 
  exhibited by ant colonies in finding food and building roads. Each ant can sense, 
  via scent, what the other ants have done and add their own behavior to a general 
  pattern. For example, when searching for food ants will leave a scent trail. 
  Other ants will follow one trail or another, but ones that lead to food will 
  tend to be repeated more often, leading to stronger scents. Further, other ants 
  finding food via a shorter path will also leave scent trails, but because it 
  is shorter will tend to get more traffic, thus drawing ants from other trails. 
  In this way the shortest path to food is eventually found and a majority of 
  ants will use it.</p>
<p>ACO is a formalization of this idea, where individual agents search about for 
  possible solutions to a problem, leaving traces of where they have been and 
  how successful. The algorithms can be used for travel planning and scheduling 
  type applications, and have their pros and cons. The papers on Marco Dorigo's 
  Web site, see <a href="#links">links</a>, provide a wealth of detailed information 
  on the algorithms and their applications.</p>
<h2><a name="fuzzy"></a>Fuzzy Logic and Health Risk</h2>
<p>Last month's issue described the use of fuzzy logic for controllers, but hinted 
  at its use in risk assessment, in particular with an eye towards coming up with 
  a way to model on the serotonin syndrome caused by certain drug interactions.</p>
<p>Fuzzy logic has been used in financial systems to estimate risk. This makes 
  sense when compared to other approaches such as certainty factors or Bayesian 
  probability. The risk isn't really a probability or a degree of certainty, but 
  rather, exactly a degree of risk, not unlike the degree of hotness or coldness 
  in a shower based on how far the knob is turned.</p>
<h3>Smoking, Exercise and Lung Cancer Risk</h3>
<p>The same idea can be applied to health risk. I used my own medical knowledge, 
  acquired by reading the newspapers to come up with a simple model to illustrate 
  this idea. It's known that the risk of getting lung cancer increases with the 
  amount of smoking a person does, and decreases with the amount of exercise a 
  person gets.</p>
<p>Using the fuzzy logic test environment we developed in the last news letter, 
  we can express these ideas as three fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rules relating the 
  sets. The fuzzy sets for the variables, <b>risk(lung_cancer)</b>, <b>smoking</b>, 
  and <b>exercise</b> follow the same pattern we used for the shower, which was 
  to have three sets for each, representing medium, high and low values.</p>
<p>The fuzzy rules are:</p>
<p><i>If smoking is low or exercise is high, then risk(lung_cancer) is low.<br>
  If smoking is medium or exercise is medium, then risk(lung_cancer) is medium.<br>
  If smoking is high or exercise is low, then risk(lung_cancer) is high.</i></p>
<p>Here's how they are coded in the fuzzy logic test environment developed in 
  the February newsletter:</p>
<pre>% from 0 to 100
fuzzy_set(risk(lung_cancer), [
   variable(low)    :: descending_line( 0, 50 ),
   variable(medium) :: triangle( 25, 50, 75 ),
   variable(high)   :: ascending_line( 50, 100 )
   ]).

% packs per day
fuzzy_set(smoking, [
   variable(low) :: descending_line( 0.0, 1.0 ),
   variable(medium)  :: triangle( 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 ),
   variable(high)    :: ascending_line( 1.0, 2.0 )
   ]).

% hours per week
fuzzy_set(exercise, [
   variable(low)     :: descending_line( 0.0, 7.0 ),
   variable(medium)  :: triangle( 3.0, 7.0, 11.0 ),
   variable(high)    :: ascending_line( 7.0, 14.0 )
   ]).
   
fuzzy_rules(risk(lung_cancer), [
   do(low)    :: smoking fzis low fzor exercise fzis high,
   do(medium) :: smoking fzis medium fzor exercise fzis medium,
   do(high)   :: smoking fzis high fzor exercise fzis low
   ]).

</pre>
<p>The risk is represented as a number from 0 to 100, although because of the 
  way the defuzzification works, it will never reach either of the end points. 
  Here are three test runs showing a high and low risk scenario, and showing how 
  someone who has one risk factor (no exercise) but not the other (doesn't smoke) 
  winds up with a total risk exactly in the middle.</p>
<pre>
how many packs a day? 3
how many hours of exercise a week? 1
risk(lung_cancer) = 83.3333

how many packs a day? 0
how many hours of exercise a week? 12
risk(lung_cancer) = 16.6667

how many packs a day? 0
how many hours of exercise a week? 0
risk(lung_cancer) = 50
</pre>
<h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3>
<p>The December newsletter discussed a system that could be used to predict drug 
  interactions based on first principles, and used as an example the serotonin 
  syndrome. That first version of the system modelled the various factors and 
  interactions of the system, but used pure boolean variables for both factors 
  and the risk of getting the serotonin syndrome. A better model for the data, 
  one that captured the inherent uncertainty of the system, was left as a future 
  project.</p>
<p>Now, fuzzy logic has found its greatest use in control systems, where it is 
  used to model smooth gradations of complex inputs and outputs of some physical 
  system. Drug interaction is the modelling of a biological system, with complex 
  inputs and outputs, and fuzzy logic might be an excellent way to implement such 
  a system.</p>
<p>The fuzzy logic system of last month's newsletter was used to try out the idea 
  on the serotonin syndrome, a result of certain drug/condition interactions.</p>
<p>The rules from the doctor were that:</p>
<p><i>The serotonin syndrome is a risk if extra cellular serotonin is high and 
  either serotonin removal is impaired or serotonin response is enhanced.<br>
  Extra cellular serotonin is high when certain drugs are consumed, of which alcohol 
  is one.<br>
  Serotonin removal is impaired by certain drugs, of which citalopram is one.<br>
  Serotonin response is enhanced by certain drugs, of which buspiron is one.</i></p>
<p>The December newsletter included more of the factors and a better ontological 
  model of drugs and effects, but to test the use of fuzzy logic, just the three 
  drugs mentioned above were used.</p>
<p>The modelling of this system using fuzzy logic involved a fuzzy set and rules 
  for <b>risk(serotonin syndrome)</b>, and three subordinate fuzzy sets and rules 
  for the pertinent factors of <b>extra cellular serotonin</b>, <b>serotonin removal</b> 
  and <b>serotonin response</b>. As with the smoking/exercise/lung_cancer example, 
  three fuzzy sets for low high and medium were used for each.</p>
<p>There is an immediate objection one might have to this approach, and that is 
  that its completely ad hoc. The degree of risk and the degree of various inputs 
  have been associated in a very arbitrary manner. This is true, so I went to 
  the doctor working on this system, who is one of the leading researchers in 
  the area, and tried to get a more concrete understanding of the relationships.</p>
<p>His response, in a nutshell, was a very educated and detailed &quot;we don't 
  know&quot;. In other words, the interactions are so complex and the research 
  is so sparse, that it really is impossible to quantify the system in any kind 
  of detailed manner. The best that probably can be done is to have a system that 
  expresses the knowledge that the risk of the serotonin syndrome increases when 
  alcohol is consumed. And that's exactly what the fuzzy logic system does.</p>
<p>Here are two runs of the system, where the amount of a given drug is given 
  on a 0-10 scale, where 0 is none and 10 is a lot. As expected, the risk is higher 
  when the factors are higher.</p>
<pre>
alcohol? 8
citalopram? 6
buspiron? 6
risk(serotonin syndrome) = 76.9942

alcohol? 2
citalopram? 2
buspiron? 2
risk(serotonin syndrome) = 18.3433
</pre>
<p>Here are the sets and rules used with the February's fuzzy logic tool set.</p>

   variable(medium) :: triangle( 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 ),
   variable(high)   :: ascending_line( 5.0, 10.0 )
   ]).
   
fuzzy_set('buspiron', [
   variable(low)    :: descending_line( 0.0, 5.0 ),
   variable(medium) :: triangle( 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 ),
   variable(high)   :: ascending_line( 5.0, 10.0 )
   ]).
</pre>
<p>There are some difficulties with the system. It handles cases where the values 
  correspond to high and low risks, but if there are balancing high and low factors 
  the system does not find an answer because no fuzzy rule applies. For example, 
  if there is a lot of extra cellular serotonin, but the serotonin removal is 
  also high, the result should be some balanced risk in the middle, but instead 
  there isn't a rule that covers that case. Better choices of fuzzy sets or a 
  more complex rule set should resolve that problem.</p>
