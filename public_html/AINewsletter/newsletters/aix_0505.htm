<H2><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
In July 2002, I went to the European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group
conference in Cardiff. After 
arriving early and discovering the shops hidden away
in Cardiff's Victorian shopping arcades, I decided to buy a few items in order to
make a point at the conference. Marker pens, fluorescent 
card, safety pin and a pair of 1970s-retro flared trousers: result, 
worn with the trousers, one badge proclaiming "Spreadsheets have not evolved
since flares were last in fashion".
</P>

<P>
This was prompted by the thought that,
although the past 25 years have brought us
1024 x 768 hi-res screens
instead of VT52 terminals, visual interfaces to
Visual Basic, and Microsoft's ubiquitously obsequious
paperclip, they have done little to solve the problem
of spreadsheet errors. As the identity of the Cardiff conference organisers
indicates, spreadsheeting
is as error-prone as ever. Excel pays more attention to
graphics than to fundamental programming problems. But on the other hand,
it also occupies an honourable place in computing, being, as
our feature on <I>Extending the Concept of Spreadsheet</I> explains, the 
world's most widely used
functional language. You can spreadsheet in Scheme; hypertext guru Ted Nelson related
his multidimensional ZigZag hypertext toolkit to spreadsheets;
and 
researchers are busy extending spreadsheets with constraint programming and logical rules.
</P>

<P> Because of their importance, we have devoted this month's issue to spreadsheets 
  and AI. On the risks side, we have a feature on my Model Master, a program which 
  uses Prolog to reduce spreadsheet errors. We look at neural nets and cellular 

  automata in Excel. And we have items by Mike Kassof from the Stanford Logic 
  Group about his work on logical spreadsheets, and by Dennis Merritt on Amzi!'s 
  ARulesXL, which by embedding logical rules in Excel, makes possible applications 
  that are not practical using Excel on its own.

<H2><A NAME="ess">Extending the Concept of Spreadsheet</A></H2>


<H3><A NAME="ess_siag">Scheme In a Grid</A></H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://siag.nu/siag/">Scheme In A Grid</A>, or Siag, is
a spreadsheet written by Ulric Eriksson
in <A HREF="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/">Scheme</A>.
It looks 
not unlike Excel, and formulae can be entered in Excel notation.
But they can also be entered in Scheme. For example,
<CODE>A1+B1</CODE> could be entered 
as <CODE>(+ a1 b1)</CODE>. In fact any Scheme function can
be called in a formula, including Siag's 
cell-access functions such as <CODE>(href N)</CODE> which
returns the contents of the cell N rows up. This makes it
convenient to do things which Excel would do only awkwardly
with macros or Visual Basic. And Siag is not limited to
numbers and strings, but can 
compute with the full range of Scheme datatypes.
</P>

<P>
Siag is part of 
<A HREF="http://siag.nu/">Siag Office</A>, a free Linux 
office package which includes a word processor, animation program, and editor,
Although Eriksson's
<A HREF="http://siag.nu/online-docs/siag/intro.html">on-line documentation</A> says that
Siag stands for "Siag Is Not An Excel Emulator",
some of its 
<A HREF="http://siag.nu/online-docs/siag/siag-functions.html">built-in functions</A> are designed 
to be Excel-compatible. Since Siag is open-source, 
these might be useful to readers needing to emulate
parts of Excel.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="ess_in_functional">Spreadsheets in functional languages</A></H3>

<P>
Older than Siag - dating from 1985 or so, it may be the first spreadsheet
to go beyond numerical calculations - is Aaron Sloman's <A HREF="#vcalc">VCalc</A>.
Sloman wrote this in Pop-11, one of the
languages making up the <A HREF="http://www.poplog.org/">Poplog</A>
system. Although written as an experiment, VCalc was used for
some serious tasks, such as
allocating limited computing connections between competing groups of
users, subject to various constraints. One feature was a
constraint checker which could run arbitrary Poplog code - for example, an
expert system could be invoked! 
</P>

<P>
VCalc is not grid-based, 
but uses declarations
in a file read by Poplog's Ved editor to indicate where
cells are to be displayed. This is excusable in a mid-1980s program
running on cursor-addressable terminals; with
modern Poplog graphics, a much better version could
be written.
</P>

<P>
Scheme and Pop-11 are both "functional" languages,
meaning that computation is expressed as function calls.
They are also said to be
"impure", because they 
contain loops, side-effects, and other
non-functional features.
In this, they contrast with the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/faq.html#purity">"pure"</A> functional languages
such as Haskell and Miranda. Because these lack side-effects,
researchers have had to devise ways for them to express input-output,
coming up with the notion of
"<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monads_in_functional_programming">monads</A>".
Functional-programming enthusiasts may be interested
to hear that monads can be used to implement
the immediate update-on-cell-change needed by
spreadsheets, using techniques
described in papers by 
Magnus Carlsson and by
Umut Acar, Guy Blelloch and Bob Harper.
Check out the <A HREF="#adaptive">links</A> for details.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="ess_as_functional">Spreadsheets as functional languages</A></H3>

<P>
Many people do not realise that Excel spreadsheets 
are functional programs. 
Of course, the Excel engine isn't -
it's probably implemented in some Microsoft dialect of C.
But the formulae a user puts into its cells are.
Write them 
as equations, and this becomes obvious:
<PRE>
  A1 = 3
  A2 = A1-32
  A3 = A2 * 5/9
</PRE>
The only computation is by function calls. This is of
more than theoretical interest. Functional languages
are much easier to reason about and analyse 
than imperative languages, a fact that should
cheer those developing spreadsheet debugging and error-detection tools.
<p></P>


<H3><A NAME="ess_excel_user_defined_functions">User-defined functions in Excel</A></H3>

<P>
Although Excel is a functional language, it is a strange one: it doesn't allow
users to define their own functions. 
As Simon Peyton Jones, Margaret Burnett and Alan Blackwell say
in their paper
<A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/projects/excel/"><I>Improving the world's most popular 
functional language: user-defined functions in Excel</I></A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From a programming language point of view, then,
<I>spreadsheets
lack the most fundamental mechanism that we use to control complexity:
the ability to define re-usable abstractions.</I> In effect, they
deny to end-user programmers the most powerful weapon in our
armory. Can you imagine programming in C without procedures,
however clever the editor’s copy-and-paste technology?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P>

<P>
They propose an extension to Excel which
permits this, whereby users define functions on separate worksheets, using
some 
cells as formal parameters. This may interest those designing
end-user spreadsheets and spreadsheet-like programs such as truth-maintenance systems.
But
what's
important 
is the authors' use of empirical studies of programmers and
research
into the psychology of programming:
As they say:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite the deficiencies of spreadsheets when they are considered
as programming languages, it is clear from their commercial success
that people find them useful and usable. This is not true to the
same extent of any traditional programming language. Why not?
One contributing factor may be that, although programming languages
are a channel of communication between people and computers,
most programming-language research is devoted to the computer
end of the channel. Comparatively little research considers
the people who do the programming. It is our belief that
programming language design projects should adopt a more usercentered
approach, in order to maintain a sharp focus on the people
who are intended to benefit from the new language features or environments
being created. This is the approach that we have adopted
in our own work on extending spreadsheet capabilities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The authors use the notions
of "Cognitive Dimensions" and "Attention Investment", two
structured
approaches to human issues in programming
developed by human-computer interaction researchers to help
computer scientists, who are not usually cognitive psychologists.
<p></P>


<H3><A NAME="ess_zigzag">Cutting spreadsheets into strips and gluing them into loops: ZigZag, GZigZag, Gzz, and Fenfire</A></H3>

<P>
A different way to broaden the spreadsheet concept,
which I discovered when reading
Chris Browne's excellent 
<A HREF="http://linuxfinances.info/info/spreadsheets.html"><I>Linux Spreadsheets</I></A> page,
is 
<A HREF="http://www.xanadu.net/zigzag/">ZigZag</A>,
invented by hypertext guru <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</A>.
He 
<A HREF="http://xanadu.com/zigzag/tutorial/ZZwelcome.html">describes it</A> as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
resembling nothing else in the 
computer field that we know of, except perhaps a spreadsheet 
cut into strips and glued into loops. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
ZigZag cells can lie in
a space of any dimensionality, not just two.
Dimensions have user-definable names: a list of
people might have one dimension for year of birth, one for
first name, and one for last name. Each dimension
would contain the same cells, but they could
be ordered differently: for example, ordering first names and last names alphabetically,
and years of birth numerically. As this shows, 
we can regard dimensions as  
labeled lists of cells. 
<p></P>

<P>
Within each dimension, a cell can have only one immediate
neighbour on each side: one "up" neighbour and
one "down". If a cell is in more than one dimension,
it may have different neighbours in each: my 
"down" neighbour in the first-name dimension might be a John Smith
(my name is Jocelyn Paine),
while in the last-name dimension, it could be Olaf Palme.
ZigZag researcher Tuomas Luuka explains this with
diagrams
in
<A HREF="http://www.nongnu.org/gzz/gi/gi.html"><I>A Gentle
Introduction to Ted Nelson's ZigZag Structure</I></A>. In a different
example, he
suggests representing trees (in the 
computing sense) in ZigZag by having one dimension that
connects a node to its parent, and another that connects siblings of the same node.
</P>

<P>
ZigZag follows two axioms: all connections must be two-directional;
and to preserve visualizability, no cell should have an enormous number of connections. 
These restrictions make it easy
for end-users to build
hyperstructures
by arranging data along various
dimensions of classification. They 
avoid dangling pointers, since all links are two-directional; and they
make it easier to display data. Finally, they simplify
programming, which - Nelson hopes - will
encourage applications programmers to
share data across application boundaries.
<P>

<P>
The most recent implementation is <A HREF="http://www.fenfire.org/">Fenfire</A>. This began
as <A HREF="http://gzigzag.sourceforge.net/">GZigZag</A>, an open-source 
ZigZag implemented by Lukka and colleagues working
with Nelson. GZigZag changed to
<A HREF="http://www.nongnu.org/gzz/">Gzz</A> after Nelson asserted his
trademark on the "ZigZag" name, and changed again to
Fenfire after he asserted his patent on the
ZigZag data structures: Fenfire has switched to RDF.
</P>

<P>
It's worth reading 
<A HREF="http://www.fenfire.org/manuscripts/2004/hyperstructure/"><I>Hyperstructure: Computers 
built around things that you care about</I></A>,
by Lukka and Benja Fallenstein. They explain
how Fenfire displays RDF as a "focus+context graph". 
Unlike with other RDF browsers, 
users can turn off relationships
they don't want to see. A nifty extension of these ideas is
FenPDF, a tool for
structuring collections of academic articles, using "buoys"
to anchor one document to those connected to it. 
</P>

<P>
I wonder whether the Fenfire browser will ever reach the
level aspired to in
a Lambda the Ultimate 
<A HREF="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/233">posting</A>. Under the
heading <I>Nelson</I>, "CrackMonkey" reminisces:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Ted Nelson handed me one of the original diskettes, 
wrapped in a triangular origami pouch of grey letter 
paper (complete with egregious claims and a high-contrast 
image of Ted's face). It was at a party in the Presidio 
of San Francisco, and he demonstrated it to partygoers 
by showing how you could set up a genealogical database 
using its N-d spatial rotation from link axis to link axis.
</P>
<P>
He said that he imagined a chair with two joysticks: one 
navigated the 2-D space you saw on the screen, and the other 
controlled which relationships the X and Y axes represented. 
It is quite a novel interface, and could be useful for 
LDAP browsers or other database query tools.
</P>
<P>
I still have the paper triangle, but the 
diskette seems to have slipped out long ago.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P>


<H3><A NAME="ess_multi">Two-dimensional programming languages</A></H3>

<P>
One message - shapr's <I>roughly Turing machine + Spreadsheet</I> 
in that Lambda the Ultimate thread points
out that GZigZag cells could hold code as well as data.
Its scripting languages usually used the cells like a Turing machine tape,
making it possible to emulate <A HREF="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheBrain">TheBrain</A>, 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikis</A>, or any sort of personal Web.
</P>

<P>
I don't know whether this has any practical use, but one can
also embed and execute code in a two-dimensional grid, creating a 
two-dimensional machine code. The languages Befunge and Orthogonal
implement this idea;
Francis
Irving's <A HREF="http://www.flourish.org/orthogonal.html">Excel implementation of Orthogonal</A>
actually sits inside a spreadsheet. As he says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The program counter can move not just right, but left, up and down as well
This makes loops neat - they are natural, and don't require that the program counter should jump. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P>

<P>
His page includes an Excel spreadsheet which implements Orthogonal, 
sample programs, and a screenshot showing Orthogonal machine instructions
inside a workbook. He speculates that Orthogonal might be important for
artificial life, perhaps as an extension of Thomas Ray's
<A HREF="http://www.his.atr.jp/~ray/tierra/">Tierra</A>. This
famous Artificial Life program featured one-dimensional creatures made
of mutatable machine code that lived and reproduced inside a virtual
machine. They evolved as Tierra ran, setting off an evolutionary
arms race which gave rise to parasites, immunity to parasites, 
hyper-parasites, social hyper-parasites, and 
hyper-hyper-parasites.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="ess_logical_spreadsheets">Logical spreadsheets</A></H3>

<P>
Let's return now to extending spreadsheets' formula languages.
Researchers in the Logic Group at Stanford are developing technology 
for "logical spreadsheets". In their version of a logical spreadsheet, the formula 
language is expanded from function definitions to general logical constraints.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional spreadsheets, logical spreadsheets can propagate values in any 
direction. For example, one might specify a start time for a room reservation along 
with an end time, and the duration of the reservation would automatically get filled in.  
Alternatively, one could specify the start time and the duration, and the end time would 
automatically get filled in.  In addition, the logical constraints can express many-to-many 
relationships instead of just functional ones.  For example, the start time for 
a reservation does not functionally determine the end time, though it does 
constrain it, since an event cannot end before it starts!  
</P>

<P>
Another example of 
a many-to-many constraint is a constraint mapping between cities and ZIP codes.  
One could select Oklahoma City, OK as the city and constrain the possible ZIP 
code choices to the 78 ZIP codes found in the <a href="http://panamaliving.com/ok.html">Sooner 
State capital</a>, or choose ZIP code 73513 and constrain the possible cities to Oklahoma City, 
OK and Moore, OK.</p>

<p>Michael Kassoff, a PhD student in the Stanford Logic Group, has 
provided us with an <a href="0505_kassof_demo.html">interactive example 
of a logical spreadsheet</a>:
<center><p><a href="0505_kassof_demo.html" target="_blank" title="Click to open up the 
interactive logical spreadsheet example"><img src="0505_kassof_demo.jpg"  border="0" alt="Interactive 
logical spreadsheet example" /></a></p></center>

<p>The example, for which a screen shot 
is shown above, contains three cells - <tt>start</tt>, <tt>end</tt>, and 
<tt>duration</tt>, as in the scenario above. It also contains two logical 
constraints. The first constraint says that the start time is before the end time.  
The second says that the start time plus the duration is the end time.</p>

<pre>  E > S WHEN start(S) AND end(E)

  E = S+D WHEN start(S) AND duration(D) AND end(E)</pre>


<p>Play around with <a href="0505_kassof_demo.html">the example</a>.  
Try entering 9:00 am as the start time.  Now, open up the end time 
menu, and notice that 7:00 am, 8:00 am and 9:00 am are colored red to 
indicate that they are incompatible choices.  Then choose 1:00 pm as 
the end time, and the duration will be automatically filled in as 4 hours.  
The duration is italicized to indicate that it is a computed value rather 
than one entered directly.  Now remove your choice of 1:00 pm for the end 
time by choosing the empty value (the top choice) from the menu, and choose 
a value for the duration.  Note that the end time is automatically filled in.</p>

<p>Logical spreadsheets can sometimes resolve conflicts automatically.  
For example, if you choose 9:00 am for the start time and then choose 8:00 
am for the end time, the start time will be automatically erased because it is 
inconsistent with your choice of end time.  Alternatively, a spreadsheet can 
keep the inconsistent values but alert the user to the problem.  As an 
example, try entering a start time of 9:00 am, an end time of 
1:00 pm, and a duration of 1 hour. These three choices are incompatible, 
so the spreadsheet indicates this problem by coloring the 
three choices red.</p>

<p>The idea of a logical spreadsheet is not entirely new.  In the 
1980's, several systems were developed that added Prolog rules to 
traditional spreadsheets, namely Frank Kriwaczek's LogiCalc spreadsheet, 
Maarten H. van Emden et al.'s unnamed system, and PERPLEX, created by 
Michael Spenke and Christian Beilken.  In addition, over the last 
15 years or so, the field of interactive constraint solvers has sprung up, 
beginning with Sanjay Mittal and Brian Falkenhainer's paper on Dynamic 
Constraint Satisfaction Problems in 1990. Logical Spreadsheets can be 
regarded as interactive CSPs in which the constraints are given in a 
logical language.</p>

<p>Logical spreadsheet technology is rapidly being transferred from academia 
to the commercial world. Last year, 
Professor Michael Genesereth approached the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) in hopes of finding funding for Stanford's 
work on logical spreadsheets. Those talks led to DARPA issuing a 
Small Business Innovation Research grants call for proposals 
on &quot;<a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir/solicitations/sbir043/darpa043.htm">deductive 
spreadsheets<a/>.&quot;  
</a></a><a/><a href="http://www.darpa.mil/sbir/20043SBIRAwards.html">Four companies</a> 
were granted initial Phase I funding, including Prolog guru David Warren's 
company, XSB. Other companies have jumped on the bandwagon too, 
for example the Prolog shop Amzi!. Stanford also has a patent 
pending on Logical Spreadsheets, which is available for 
licensing to some interested company.  Can it be too long 
before logical spreadsheet technology is on your desktop?</a></p><a/>

<h2><A NAME="arulesxl">ARulesXL - Integrating Rules with Spreadsheets</A></h2>

<p>Spreadsheets with their intuitive interface and internal calculation engine
  are excellent tools for numerical analysis. Rule-based systems with their declarative 
  rule specifications and internal inference engine are excellent tools for decision 
  support applications.</p>

<p>ARulesXL is a new product that integrates the two technologies. It uses the 
  spreadsheet's intuitive interface for the definition of rules and provides spreadsheet 
  functions that allow the rules to be queried from other spreadsheet cells as 
  shown in the diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="0505_dm_integration_architecture.gif" width="240" height="175"></p>

<p>Because the definitions and queries are in spreadsheet cells, they can include 
  references to other spreadsheet cells so that they become part of the spreadsheet's 
  dependency graphs used for automatic recalculation. When the rules change, or 
  values the rules depend on change, then the results of queries based on those 
  rules are automatically updated.</p>

<p>The following screen shot shows an example of how telephone pricing rules can 
  be implemented in a spreadsheet using ARulesXL (if the pictures don't show up, 
  visit <a href="http://www.ainewsletter.com">www.ainewsletter.com</a>).</p>

<p><img src="0505_arulesxl.gif" width="893" height="893"></p>

<p>While it might be possible to implement this spreadsheet using conventional 
  Excel IF statements, it would be difficult to write and considerably more difficult 
  for the call pricing marketing expert to read and verify as correct.</p>

<p>Because the rules are clearer, they allow for the encoding, verification, and 
  maintenance of more complex sets of business rules, making possible applications 
  that are not practical using conventional spreadsheet capabilities alone. Applications 
  such as taxes, human resources, benefits, work flow, pricing, underwriting, 
  loan approval, legal advice and configuration all become viable spread sheet 
  applications.</p>

<H2><A NAME="numerical_ai">Numerical AI in Excel</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="numerical_ai_neural_nets">Neural nets</A></H3>

<P>
I managed to find quite a few neural net spreadsheets, some of which I've
linked at the end.
One nice 
<A HREF="http://www.bcp.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Book2/Excel/index.html">pedagogical collection</A>,
including
Adaline and a Hebbian learner, has been 
put on the
Web by Michael Dawson at Alberta, author of
<I>Minds And Machines: Connectionism And Psychological
Modeling</I>. 
</P>

<P>
One of his spreadsheets is a
Hopfield net. This raises a problem, because Hopfield
nets model a dynamical process
similar to the settling of compass
needles in a magnetic field. The customary simulation 
requires neurons' activations to be repeatedly updated
until they converge. As far as I know, such
iterative processes can't be written in pure Excel. However, one can
code them in Visual Basic, C, and other languages, by
writing "add-in" functions that
are called from
formulae as though built-in, and which can
use loops and recursion to do iterative calculations.
Details can be found in most Excel Developers' guides.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="numerical_ai_front_ending">Spreadsheets as front-ends</A></H3>

<P>
The add-ins idea can be taken further, so that we use Excel
merely as a front-end for input and display of data
(why write your own charting and graphing packages when
Excel provides such a variety), delegating
all calculations to functions in some other language.
I mention this because there are several such programs available.
One - certainly not the only one - is the nicely presented
<A HREF="http://www.neurosolutions.com/products/nsexcel/introduction.html">NeuroSolutions
for Excel</A>, an add-in that interfaces Excel to NeuroSolutions's
neural network simulator:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You simply highlight portions of your data as training, cross validation, or 
testing within your Excel spreadsheet, step through a few configuration panels, 
and you have a working neural network. Configure another panel and watch Excel 
graph the results from a batch of experiments. 
This powerful feature allows you to easily determine the optimum network parameters.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p></P>

<P>
It's worth noting that there is another way to
use Excel as a front end: inputting data
to Excel, but then saving the spreadsheet
to a file which is read and processed by another program.
Indeed, we can save formulae into such a file
as well as constant data.
Should some
problem be best
defined as a set of equations, they
could be input to Excel, saved to file, and processed
in your favourite compiler-writing language.
I don't know any AI programs front-ended by Excel in this way,
but I did find
others that are, such as StrongWare's
<A HREF="http://www.strongware.com/modeling.htm">software for
modelling flow paths</A>.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="numerical_ai_cellular_automata">Cellular automata</A></H3>

<P>
Like Hopfield nets, simulating cellular automata requires iterative updating. However,
if we decide in 
advance how many generations we want to display, there is a trick by which
we can implement them without add-ins. 
As Chris Hand explains in his paper 
<A HREF="http://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/cheer/ch17/hand.htm"><I>Simple Cellular Automata on a Spreadsheet</I></A>,
you have to make one copy of
the cellular automaton grid for each generation. Each
grid except the first contains state-change formulae in its cells: these refer to the <I>previous</I> grid. 
Excel's normal spreadsheet updating rules will then propagate state from one
generation to the next.
This kind of display is useful in teaching. A good example
is a
<A HREF="http://www.complexmarkets.com/cellularworld.html">"small worlds" CA</A>,
on the Complex Markets site,
which
models a market divided into "small-world communities". 
Individuals communicate with their immediate neighbours,
the strength of communication depending on whether the communication stays within
a community or crosses from one to another.

<A HREF="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/24/1218239&from=rss">Slashdot posting</A> reports that,
according to both PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG, more than 90% of corporate 
spreadsheets contain material errors. With each error 
costing between $10K and 100K per month, one expert 
estimates corporate America loses in excess of $10B annually 
through the misuse and abuse of spreadsheets. 
</P>

<P>
There are many
many stories counting the costs of spreadsheet errors, some of which have been
collected on the
<A HREF="http://www.eusprig.org/stories.htm">European Spreadsheet
Risks Group</A> site. In the US,
eliminating such
risks has become urgent because of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. And it's not just large multinationals
who are affected. SF author and critic
David Langford
<A HREF="http://www.ansible.co.uk/">recounts</A> how his
publishers sent him only half the
royalties he was due because a call to
<CODE>SUM</CODE> in their royalties spreadsheet
omitted to total some of its cells.
</P>

<P>
Reasons for such errors include:
use of alphanumeric cell names instead of
meaningful identifiers; the lack of user-defined
functions; no good way to reuse code from existing
spreadsheets; and the difficulty of
managing spreadsheets with code-control
systems such as 
CVS. Most
importantly, because few spreadsheet end-users and managers are
trained in programming, they don't realise how
prone we all are to make mistakes, and how vital it
is to guard against them. 
</P>


<H3><A NAME="excelsior_equations">Spreadsheets as equations</A></H3>

<P>
Model Master, or MM, is 
a Prolog program which I wrote to make spreadsheeting safer. The
idea behind it is that spreadsheets are, as
our first feature explained, sets of equations. By listing and
transforming these, we can make existing spreadsheets
more understandable. And by going the other way,
compiling sets of equations into spreadsheets,
we gain the benefits of textual source code: 
easy to print, easy to edit, easy to reuse, easy to enter into
code-control systems.
</P>

<P>
To apreciate this, look at these equations, which 
could come from a simple accounting spreadsheet:
<PRE>
  A2 = 2000
  A3 = 2001
  B2 = 1492
  B3 = 1560
  C2 = 971
  C3 = 1803
  D2 = C2 - B2 
  D3 = C3 - B3 
</PRE>
Notice how they become immediately clear
when we rewrite them as:
<PRE>
  Year[2000] = 2000
  Year[2001] = 2001
  Sales[2000] = 971 <I>etc.</I>
  Profit[2000] = Sales[2000] - Expenses[2000]  
  Profit[2001] = Sales[2001] - Expenses[2001]  
  Layout Year[2000:] as A2 downwards
  Layout Expenses[2000:] as B2 downwards
  Layout Sales[2000:] as C2 downwards
  Layout Profit[2000:] as D2 downwards
</PRE>
<p></P>


<H3><A NAME="excelsior_cdre">Compiling, decompiling, and structure discovery</A></H3>

<P>
MM contains a compiler for converting such specifications to
spreadsheets. It
reads the equations and layout directives, then
uses the latter to allocate identifiers in the equations to cells,
saving the result as a spreadsheet. This is extremely powerful,
because by varying the layouts, we can map the same equations to a spreadsheet in many different
ways. Thus we could
compile the same three-dimensional table to vertically stacked 2-d cross-sections
in one spreadsheet, to a horizontal sequence of cross-sections in another, and
to one slice per worksheet in a third. It is equally easy to
run data from right to left, to accomodate Hebrew and Arabic
readers. An extension to the layout directives allows labels
to be added, making it easy to internationalize the text 
in a spreadsheet.
</P>

<P>
There is also a decompiler which converts spreadsheets back to
equations. When it is given layout directives,
it applies the inverse mapping to the compiler. So, given my first
listing and the layout directives from the second, it would
generate the equations from the second listing.
</P>

<P>
If a spreadsheet has been generated by the compiler, we will
know how to group and rename its cells on decompilation. However, this won't
be the case for the overwhelming majority of spreadsheets.
To make them intelligible, we need to discover their authors'
intentions, i.e. what arrays they had in mind when coding.
I call this the
problem of "structure discovery".
</P>


<H3><A NAME="excelsior_spreadsheet_grammars">Structure discovery and spreadsheet grammars</A></H3>

<P>
There are heuristics we can use to guess at a spreadsheet's implicit structure.
To find out which cells belong in the same array,
we can: look for regions surrounded by text or blank cells; 
sequences of identical formulae; and regions passed as ranges to 
<CODE>SUM</CODE> and other aggregating functions. To discover the array bounds, we
can look for sequences of numbers such as the years in my listings, and
for sequences of common words such as the names of months. These will often run along a row, 
telling the reader the subscripts associated with the cells below; or down a column,
subscripting the cells to their right.
To guess
names for these arrays, we can use labels in neighbouring cells, 
especially those above or to their left.
</P>

<P>
Such heuristics can be programmed directly in Prolog, but what's
nice is that we can write them more concisely
by using Definite Clause Grammars.
For non-Prologers, I should explain that Prolog
has a special notation for writing BNF-like grammars
known as Definite Clause Grammars, plus a translator to convert them a to
parser. Amzi!'s 
<A HREF="http://www.amzi.com/manuals/amzi7/pro/ref_dcg.htm">tutorial on DCGs</A> gives more details, and
demonstrates with a
a grammar for (simple!) English
sentences:
<PRE>
  sentence --&gt;
    subject,
    verb,
    object.

  subject --&gt;
    modifier,
    noun.

  object --&gt;
    modifier,
    noun.

  modifier --&gt; [the].

  noun --&gt; [cat].
  noun --&gt; [mouse].

  verb --&gt; [chases].
  verb --&gt; [eats].
</PRE>
<p></P>

<P>
We can devise similar rules to search for structure in
spreadsheets. This rule 
searches for a label (which I define as a spreadsheet cell containing
text and having no dependents) with a cell
containing a formula on its immediate right:
<PRE>
  labelled_cell( L ) --&gt; label(N), right(1), formula_cell, at(A), 
                         L is_layout [ name=N, address=A, subscript=[] ].
</PRE>
When this rule is applied to a spreadsheet, if it
finds a labelled cell, it creates a layout structure in
variable <CODE>L</CODE>, giving it
a name field equal to the label's text, and
a base address or origin which is that of the formula cell. It also
puts an empty subscript into the structure, signifying that
the cell stands on its
own rather than being part of an array. (Cells in arrays
would get subscripts indicating their position relative to
the array origin.) The layout structure is the internal
representation of the <CODE>Layout</CODE> directives shown
earlier.
<p></P>


<H3><A NAME="excelsior_prolog_interface">Prolog as a spreadsheet-manipulation language</A></H3>

<P>
Prolog programmers can use the Prolog top-level interpreter
as an
interactive interface to MM's spreadsheet predicates, with backtracking
useful for returning alternative solutions. For example, the query below
would find all formulae in Sheet1 whose top-level operator is a plus: 
<PRE>
  ?- load( 'spreadsheet.xml', SS ),
     cell( SS, 'Sheet1', Col, Row, Formula ),
     Sub = _+_,
     subexpression( Formula, Sub ).
</PRE>
Here, <CODE>load</CODE> reads a spreadsheet
file, <CODE>cell</CODE> looks up the contents of cells, and 
<CODE>subexpression</CODE> matches subexpressions in formulae.
<p></P>

<P>
MM's compiler and decompiler can be called from Prolog too.
These take spreadsheets or sets of equations as arguments (MM represents a spreadsheet as
a 
set of equations augmented with cell styles, named ranges, and
other Excel stuff), as well as lists of layout structures. For example,
<PRE>
  ?- load( 'ss.xml', SS ),
     match_all( SS, labelled_cell, Layouts ),
     decompile( SS, Layouts, Decompiled ),
     show( Decompiled ).
</PRE>
This query reads the file <CODE>ss.xml</CODE> into <CODE>SS</CODE>,
applies our labelled-cell rule as many times as it can, gathering
all the layouts into <CODE>Layouts</CODE>, runs them backwards
generating <CODE>Decompiled</CODE>, and displays the transformed - and, we hope,
more
intelligible - listing.
<p></P>

<P>
We also have operators for combining spreadsheets and parts of spreadsheets, making
it possible to reuse them.
The most fundamental are <CODE>\/</CODE>, which
overlays two spreadsheets (the symbol is the nearest a keyboard can come
to set union); <CODE>&gt;&gt;</CODE>, which shifts a spreadsheet along a vector;
and <CODE>-</CODE> and <CODE>restrict</CODE>, which remove cells, ranges, and sheets
from a spreadsheet:
<PRE>
  ?- load( 's1.xml', S1 ),
     load( 's2.xml', S2 ),
     S3 is_ss ( S1 restrict 'Sheet1' sub [a,c:d] ) \/
              ( S2 restrict 'Sheet1' sub b ),
     save( 's3.xml', S3 ). 
</PRE>
Suppose that we have two accounting spreadsheets,
both containing years in column A, expenses in B, sales in C, and profit calculations in D.
We want to build a new spreadsheet which uses the sales from one and the expenses from
the other. As the code above shows, it's easy - we isolate columns A, C and D from the first,
and B from the second, by calling <CODE>restrict</CODE>. We then superimpose them with
the spreadsheet union operator <CODE>\/</CODE>. The result is saved to 
<CODE>s3.xml</CODE>.
<p></P>

<P>
If, for some strange reason, the second spreadsheet had its expenses running horizontally
from cell A2 rightwards, we could still use them:
<PRE>
  ?- load( 's1.xml', S1 ),
     load( 's2.xml', S2 ),
     S3 is_ss ( S1 restrict 'Sheet1' sub [a,c:d] ) \/
              ( S2 restrict 'Sheet1' sub 1 ) rebase [ a2, b2, vector(1,0), vector(0,1) ],
     save( 's3.xml', S3 ). 
</PRE>
What's new is <CODE>rebase</CODE>, which maps one set of cells
into another. Here, it is given the origin of the source and
target cells, and the increments between cells.
<p></P>


<H3><A NAME="excelsior_scripting_language">The Excelsior scripting language</A></H3>

<P>
Until some genius equips Prolog with a telepathy interface, we can never
be sure we have uncovered a spreadsheet author's intentions. We may therefore
need a lot of
trial and error when doing our structure discovery. To support this, 
it would be useful to have a user-interface similar to Mathematica and other
computer-algebra systems: see <A HREF="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/EXT/ASTEX/astex/doc/en/rosetta/htmla/roseta.htm"><I>The 
Rosetta Stone for Computer Algebra Systems</I></A>
for a comparison of
approaches. Such an interface should give the user some way to store for later use spreadsheets,
parts of spreadsheets, cell addresses, formulae, and equations generated by
structure discovery. It should obviously be interactive, and should -
building on what existing computer-algebra systems find most usable -
be functional rather than logic-based, meaning that commands typed at it
are treated as expressions to be evaluated, rather than Prolog queries.
</P>

<P>
In addition, although the operator notation in the previous section
will be manageable to Prolog experts, it suffers from the syntactic compromises
needed to make it go through Prolog's parser. For example, 
<CODE>Sheet1</CODE> had to go in single quotes to stop Prolog treating it
as a variable. To overcome these problems, MM has its own
scripting language, Excelsior. This was implemented for a group
of systems-admin users: the type of person who doesn't know
Prolog, but is prepared to hack languages like Perl and Python. Such users
can use Excelsior as a batch language for automating spreadsheet
editing, in the same way they'd use Perl for string-bashing.
They can also use it interactively as a "spreadsheet algebra" language for
trial-and-error reverse enineering.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="excelsior_rev_eng_ca">Reverse-engineering a cellular automaton</A></H3>

<P>
In the <I>Numerical AI in Excel</I> feature, 
I mentioned the
small-worlds cellular automaton spreadsheet.
Because it lays out 26 successive generations of its CA
down one worksheet, it holds a vast
amount of repetitive structure, both within
each generation's grid, and from one grid to another. 
I experimented with MM for making this structure explicit, and
found that
by searching the spreadsheet for identical formulae, 
then grouping these into runs, and runs of runs, I could
list the spreadsheet very compactly.
</P>

<P>
One such set was listed as 
<PRE>
  Sheet1[ {0} &gt;&lt; { 4..829 by 33 } ] = "step=".
</PRE>
The expression inside the square brackets specify a whole
set of worksheet addresses. In it,
the symbol <CODE>&gt;&lt;</CODE> denotes
Cartesian product, i.e. the product of two sets.
These are sets of subscripts, the first being 
a set of column indices (based at 0), and the second a set
of row indices. As conventional, they are
enclosed in curly brackets. So the equation means that
the cells in 
rows 4, 37, 70, ... 829 of column 0
contain the label <CODE>step=</CODE>.
<p></P>

<P>
Similarly, 
the cells in rows 
6, 39, 72, ... 831 of column 0
contain the constant 1.
So do the
cells in rows 4, 37, 70, ... 829 of column 2.
And the cells in
rows 37, 70, ... 829 of column 1
contain the relative formula <CODE>R[-33]C+1</CODE>.
MM displays this as
<PRE>
  Sheet1[ {1} &gt;&lt; { 37..829 by 33 } ] = Sheet1[ HERE, HERE - 33 ]+1
</PRE>
This is a very compact listing: 
whereas the original Excel file occupied
1.8 Mb, the MM listing was only 14K and
contained 17 equations.
<p></P>

<P>
Using the MM compiler, we can reverse this,
generating a spreadsheet <I>from</I> such listings, making it
very easy to experiment with spreadsheet-based cellular automata.
</P>

<P>
Along the same lines, MM has been used
to convert an assortment of spreadsheet-based simulations
into equations which can then be reimplemented in other programming languages, including:
<A HREF="http://www.lumina.com/">Lumina</A>'s Analytica
modelling package; Java; 
and numerical languages such as Fortran. 
</P>


<H3><A NAME="excelsior_financial">MM in finance: from category theory to billion-dollar loans</A></H3>

<P>
One experiment with MM, which I tried at the suggestion of
UK accountant and spreadsheet expert 
<A HREF="http://www.duncanwil.co.uk/">Duncan Willamson</A>, used it
to edit accounts spreadsheets. Apparently, these often fail to balance at the end
of the accounting year, because some credits or debits are wrong.
Accountants rectify this by patching with corrections such as
"The sales department must be noted to have spent an extra &pound;200".
(I'm not an accountant, so this explanation may not be
quite right.)
Making these edits in Excel would require
inserting extra input rows containing the correction, then updating
all cell references in the calculations sheet so that they use
the corrected inputs rather than the originals. This is tedious and
error-prone. However, it was easy to code the edits in
Prolog.
</P>

<P>
I've also worked with a US investment bank on a much bigger application,
MM as the basis of a tool for 
checking that the
bank's spreadsheets conform to in-house style rules and that
their units (money, years, months, interest rates, and so on) are consistent,
and that malicious users have not tampered with
local copies of certain spreadsheets. 
</P>

<P>
I'll end by saying a bit about mathematics. I had the idea of MM by chance,
as a result of work in
a branch of mathematics called 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</A>. This is an 
<A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/pps/manif.ps">important</A> and
foundational (also elegant, recursive, and highly self-similar)
subject, which allows one to combine varied
mathematical and computational
views of the same situation, snapping them
together like Lego bricks. 
I can't imagine, though, many people running to buy a
book on <I>Category Theory with Excel</I>. This would be a pity,
because I found the subject 
extremely helpful, both in inspiring MM,
and in clarifying its design.
Some of the investment bank spreadsheets
are used in assessing loans: loans
which may run to several billion dollars. 
With mathematics comes power.

by Paul Thagard and Cameron Shelley,
<A HREF="http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/Pages/emotional-analogies.html"><I>Emotional 
Analogies and Analogical Inference</I></A>. Such jokes are funny,
they explain, because:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of the most enjoyable uses of analogy is to make people laugh, generating the 
emotional state of mirth or amusement. The University of Michigan recently ran an 
informational campaign to get people to guard their computer passwords more carefully. 
Posters warn students to treat their computer passwords like underwear: make them long 
and mysterious, don't leave them lying around, and change them often. The point of the 
analogy is not to persuade anyone based on the similarity between passwords and underwear, 
but rather to generate amusement that focuses attention on the problem of password security.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The password analogy works because
part of what makes an analogy funny is a
surprising combination 
of congruity and incongruity. Passwords and underwear are different,
so it surprises us when we find a similarity. Such similarities are
particularly amusing when directed at people we dislike.
