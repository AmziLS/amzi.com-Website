            <p> This month, I've written another AI Alphabet. I hope - one of 
              the entries will explain this - that after reading it, you will 
              be thinking globally and breadth-first, not locally and depth-first.

            <h2><a name="adi">Logic Programming in C++ with LC++</a></h2>
            <p> Adi Shavit wrote to tell me about the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/lc++/">LC++ 
              library</a>, developed by Brian McNamara and Yannis Smaragdakis, 
              at www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/lc++/. The library uses macros to enable 
              users to write in a Prolog-like syntax inside C++ programs. For 
              example, here are some fragments of code from the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/lc++/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>: 
            <pre>

  FUN2(parent,string,string)

  FUN3(ancestor,string,string,int)



  DECLARE(Kid, string,2);

  DECLARE(Par, string,3);

  DECLARE(Anc, string,8);

  DECLARE(Tmp, string,9);

  DECLARE(X   ,int,  10);

  DECLARE(Y   ,int,  11);



  string bart="bart", lisa="lisa", maggie="maggie", marge="marge";,



  lassert( parent(marge,bart) );

  lassert( parent(marge,lisa) );

  lassert( parent(marge,maggie) );



  lassert( ancestor(Par,Kid,1) -= parent(Par,Kid) );

  lassert( ancestor(Anc,Kid,X) -= parent(Anc,Tmp) &&

              ancestor(Tmp,Kid,Y) && X.is(plus,Y,1) );

     

  iquery( ancestor(Anc,bart,X) );

</pre>
            These declare the functors <code>parent</code> and <code>ancestor</code> 
            and some logical variables and constants, assert a few rules, and 
            then do a query.

              of robots and programs to cope with unexpected developments. They 
              mention a contestant in the DARPA Grand Challenge, where robots 
              had to negotiate their way through a real-world journey. This one 
              drove into a fence it could not see, and then continued trying to 
              move forward for the rest of the contest. The robot was brittle. 
              Sadly, the fence was not. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p> Suppose I am an AI agent in a video game: I have to shoot and 
              disable a swarm of killer bees. Had I been designed around the principles 
              of Good Old-Fashioned AI, the core of my cognition would be a propositional 
              world-model continuously updated by interpreting sensory data, and 
              I would represent each bee as a unique object within a world-centered 
              coordinate system: 
            <blockquote> I see a bee. Sense data indicates I haven't seen it before. 
              So I'll give it a new ID: <br>
              <code>see( me, bee-12374 ). is_yellow( bee-12374 ). is_flying( bee-12374 
              ).</code><br>
              I turn my head. Then I turn back. I see a bee.<br>
              Is this new image I see also <code>bee-12374</code>, or is it a 
              different object to which I must allocate an ID?<br>
              And if the latter, how long must I retain my knowledge about <code>bee-12374</code>? 
            </blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> In contrast, deictic representations try to avoid problems of 
              instance identification and world-model update by being relative 
              to the agent and its intentions: this bee in front of me, which 
              I am aiming at and intend to kill. The paper explains deictic representations, 
              with references to important prior research, and proposes how the 
              brain might use body movements such as changes in gaze position 
              as deictic pointers. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p> Many people will know of Norman from his book <i>The Design of 
              Everyday Things</i>. (The cover of one edition depicts a coffee 
              pot with its spout on the same side as its handle.) In this <a href="#u"><i>Ubiquity</i></a> 
              interview on his <i>The Future of Everyday Things</i>, Norman explains 
              why we should pay more attention to fun: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Norman: If you make something more pleasant, it's easier to 
                use. (My first article on this subject is going to be published 
                in the July/August 2002 issue of ACM's Interactions magazine.) 
                The usability community has not paid enough attention to beauty, 
                to fun, or to pleasure. I'd like to change that. The theme of 
                affect and emotion is growing so much within me that I'm considering 
                changing the title and focus of the book to "Emotion and Design." 
              </p>
              <p> Ubiquity: Incidentally, your own Web site, http://www.jnd.org/, 
                is very nice, especially the trailing balls that follow cursor 
                movement on the "Gratuitous Graphics" page. Do many Web sites 
                achieve the right balance of fun and seriousness? </p>
              <p> Norman: Not enough. For a lot of Web sites, it's all or none. 
                It's rare to find a Web site that's really fun. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> Emotion may be vital to AI programs as well as to their users. 
              Without it, they may be unable to adapt correctly to threats and 
              opportunities. As Norman explains, 
            <blockquote> the brain changes when we are happy, making pleasant 
              objects easier to use. We are global, breadth-first thinkers when 
              happy, local, depth-first thinkers when stressed. Affect is truly 
              an important factor in how we live in the world. There are a lot 
              of exciting new findings. I want to bring them to the attention 
              of designers - and engineers who build large, complex, autonomous 
              systems. </blockquote>

              <i>Cognitive wheels: The frame problem of AI</i>: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Once upon a time there was a robot, named R1 by its creators. 
                Its only task was to fend for itself. One day its designers arranged 
                for it to learn that its spare battery, its precious energy supply, 
                was locked in a room with a time bomb set to go off soon. R1 located 
                the room, and the key to the door, and formulated a plan to rescue 
                its battery. There was a wagon in the room, and the battery was 
                on the wagon, and R1 hypothesized that a certain action which 
                it called PULLOUT(WAGON, ROOM) would result in the battery being 
                removed from the room. Straightaway it acted, and did succeed 
                in getting the battery out of the room before the bomb went off. 
                Unfortunately, however, the bomb was also on the wagon. R1 knew 
                that the bomb was on the wagon in the room, but didn't realize 
                that pulling the wagon would bring the bomb out along with the 
                battery. Poor R1 had missed that obvious implication of its planned 
                act. </p>
              <p> Back to the drawing board. "The solution is obvious," said the 
                designers. "Our next robot must be made to recognize not just 
                the intended implications of its acts, but also the implications 
                about their side-effects, by deducing these implications from 
                the descriptions it uses in formulating its plans." They called 
                their next model, the robot-deducer, R1D1. They placed R1D1 in 
                much the same predicament that R1 had succumbed to, and as it 
                too hit upon the idea of PULLOUT(WAGON, ROOM) it began, as designed, 
                to consider the implications of such a course of action. It had 
                just finished deducing that pulling the wagon out of the room 
                would not change the colour of the room's walls, and was embarking 
                on a proof of the further implication that pulling the wagon out 
                would cause its wheels to turn more revolutions than there were 
                wheels on the wagon . . . when the bomb exploded. </p>
              <p> Back to the drawing board. "We must teach it the difference 
                between relevant implications and irrelevant implications," said 
                the designers, "and teach it to ignore the irrelevant ones." So 
                they developed a method of tagging implications as either relevant 
                or irrelevant to the project at hand, and installed the method 
                in their next model, the robot-relevant-deducer, R2D1 for short. 
                When they subjected R2D1to the test that had so unequivocally 
                selected its ancestors for extinction, they were surprised to 
                see it sitting, Hamlet-like, outside the room containing the ticking 
                bomb, the native hue of its resolution sicklied o'er with the 
                pale cast of thought, as Shakespeare (and more recently Fodor) 
                has aptly put it. "Do something!" they yelled at it. "I am," it 
                retorted. "I'm busily ignoring some thousands of implications 
                I have determined to be irrelevant. Just as soon as I find an 
                irrelevant implication, I put it on the list of those I must ignore, 
                and . . ." the bomb went off. </p>

            <p> In a robot arm, inverse kinematics is the problem of calculating 
              what angles the joints need to be in order to get the end of the 
              arm - the "hand" - to a desired position. This is a rather useful 
              thing to know if the robot wants to reach towards and grab something. 
              Forward kinematics - finding the hand position from the joint angles 
              - is easy. Inverse kinematics is not, which is why a lot has been 
              written about it, such as the nice article by <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_ik2.htm">Hugo 
              Elias</a>. </p>
            <p> In <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/virtual-storytelling/">Building 
              Virtual Actors Who Can Really Act</a>, Ken Perlin uses inverse kinematics 
              to make game characters more plausible. Too many game characters 
              move in exactly the same way whatever their psychological state. 
              But as any animator knows, movement depends on mood; Wile E. Coyote 
              may bound along expectantly as he's about to unwrap his new ACME

              Your Own Tornados Kit</a>, but he'll move rather differently when 
              the tornados turn and come after him. Perlin's work involves fine-tuning 
              or "shading" body movements to convey such subtleties. He does a

            <p> John von Neumann said that "life is a process which may be abstracted 
              from other media". If this is so, then just as we can study software 
              independently of the hardware that runs it, we can study life independently 
              of the matter that embodies it. One big question is how self-replicating 
              molecules arose. Did it happen all at once, or over several stages? 
              Is it logically necessary that if self-replicators arose elsewhere, 
              they would do so in the "same" way, and if so, how can we characterise 
              the kind of organisation involved? Artificial chemistry tries to 
              answer such questions by setting up mathematical models of chemical 
              reactions, keeping those properties needed to explain biological 
              organisation while throwing away the rest. </p>
            <p> One of the first artificial chemistry models, that of Fontana 
              and Buss, was based on &lambda;-calculus. Chemical reactions combine 
              molecules to form new molecules, and we normally think of molecules 
              as objects. But molecules are also functions: if given alcohol as 
              an argument, water just mixes with it, but to sodium it does something 
              more ferocious. (Certain chemists of my acquaintance used to dispose 
              of sodium waste from their organic syntheses by tossing it into 
              the Cherwell, presumably to frighten passing punts.) So we want 
              a system whose elements are objects and at the same time functions 
              that can act on these objects; which is what &lambda;-calculus provides.

              that MIT should simply give its course materials away. With funding 
              from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett 
              Foundation, the result was MIT's OpenCourseWare programme. To quote 
              from one of many testimonials, from Maruf Muqtadir studying in Bangladesh: 
            <blockquote> Your OpenCourseWare is an amazing and remarkable step!

              to know about the institution, its unique teaching methods, but 
              for many reasons I am not able to do so. This initiative gives me

            <p> Imagine you are an engineering student at an Oxford college (I 
              mention no names) which admits students good either at engineering 
              - the <a href="http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/guide/cartoonist/adayinthelifeofanundergraduate.html">Gnomes</a> 
              - or at rugby - the <a href="http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/guide/cartoonist/adayinthelifeofanundergraduate.html">Hearties</a>. 
              Suppose there's no correlation at all between being good at rugby 
              and being good at engineering. However, as a Gnome, you are naturally 
              biased against your beer-swilling rugby-playing fellows, and you 
              decide to seek proof that their brains are abnormally small. You 
              wander the grounds with your laptop and stats software, note the 
              engineering and rugby ability of each co-student you pass, and then 
              press "Compute Correlation". And Bingo!, you will see a negative 
              correlation coefficient. (You can see why if you draw a <a href="http://www.ukar.org/corr/corr02.html">scatterplot</a> 
              for <i>all</i> the students who applied to the college, chop out 
              the area for those not admitted, and then consider the regression 
              line for those left on the plot.) </p>
            <p> This is Berkson's paradox, also known as "explaining away", and 
              it's one of many topics discussed in Murphy's excellent paper on 
              inference and learning with Bayesian networks, which also relates 
              them to Kalman filters, Hidden Markov Models, and a number of other 
              models. Bayesian networks have become popular in AI - as one researcher 
              has said, they offer an efficient way to deal with the lack or ambiguity 
              of information that has hampered previous systems, and provide an 
              overarching graphical framework that brings together diverse elements 
              of AI, increasing its range of application to the real world. Murphy,

              embedded in Microsoft's products, including the Answer Wizard of 
              Office 95, the Paperclip, and over 30 Technical Support Troubleshooters.

            <p> "Qualia" is the philosophical term for subjective experiences: 
              seeing red, feeling the sting of a wasp, tasting horseradish sauce. 
              The <a href="http://www.consciousentities.com/mogi.htm">Sony Qualia 
              Man</a> page claims that Sony take a close interest in qualia - 
              as perhaps should any entertainment company - and that Ken Mogi, 
              leader of their qualia project, has published a <a href="http://www.qualia-manifesto.com/">Qualia 
              Manifesto</a> calling for more of the things. </p>
            <p> Many philosophers say qualia are the most important problem for 
              the philosophy of mind. Why should I believe that you have subjective 
              experiences? If you do, are they anything like mine, or could it 
              be that whenever I see red, you see green? Will Artificial Intelligences 
              have subjective experiences? If so, can we predict them from the 
              nature of their programs? David Chalmers, who also wrote the Matrix 
              as Metaphysics feature referenced in my <a href="#w">Where am I?</a> 
              entry, discusses these problems in <a href="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html">Absent 
              Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia</a>. </p>
            <p> I predict that if we can ever know an AI's qualia, it won't be 
              long before someone publishes a book on <i>How to Make Your Computer

            <p> Swarm Intelligence uses many simple agents to generate useful 
              global behaviour via local interactions, no central controller needed. 
              This site links to researchers, papers, software, and conferences. 
              An interview with Eric Bonabeau, who has applied swarm intelligence 
              to routing in telecoms systems, <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2003/02/21/bonabeau.html">remembers 
              how</a>: 
            <blockquote> As a kid I'd always been terrified of insects. I remember 
              with retrospective anguish my holidays in the south of France, when 
              picnics turned into nightmarish fights against carnivorous wasps 
              and ferocious ants raiding my sandwich. Sometimes I wonder how on 
              earth I could dedicate eight years of my life to social insects. 
              This large scale psychoanalytic phase transition took place in the 
              early 1990's in Santa Fe, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, the 
              southernmost city before the New Mexican desert takes over. As a 
              France Telecom R&amp;D engineer, I was an unlikely candidate for 
              such a radical transformation. </blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p> He continues by explaining that although one social insect may 
              not be capable of much, a colony can achieve great things. A colony 
              of ants can collectively find out where the nearest and richest 
              food source is located, although no individual ant knows. If a food 
              source is put near an ant nest, separated from it by a bridge with 
              two branches, the colony is most likely to find the shorter branch. 
              By laying and following pheremone trails, the ants perform an emergent 
              computation, a route optimisation. </p>

            <p> This is a nice paper on a course where final-year undergraduates 
              at Bradford University were taught to build AIs for the real-time 
              Artificial Life environment Terrarium Academic and the board game 
              Virus. The authors aren't the first to teach via games - a famous 
              example during the expert systems boom was <a href="http://www2.parc.com/istl/members/stefik/loops.html">Truckin'</a>, 
              a game developed by Mark Stefik and others at Xerox Parc for teaching 
              LOOPS. Indeed, I've done this too, with <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/traveller/design.html">Traveller</a> 
              and <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/teaching_with_agents.html">Eden</a>. 
              So I'm not surprised to read that the Bradford students very much 
              liked this style of Artificial Intelligence teaching, and that the 
              authors hope to make freely available the clients and servers they 
              built to enable different AIs to compete. </p>

              interesting language, being entirely functional; and although we 
              often think of XML as representing text, it can in fact represent 
              general trees, so XSLT is a tree-transformation language. Ben-Kiki's

            <blockquote> 
              <p> Getting back to the history lesson, the prospects for the decade 
                look mostly medical. Progress is expected to speed up shortly, 
                as the fundamental patents in genomic engineering begin to expire: 
                the Free Chromosome Foundation has already published a manifesto 
                calling for the creation of an intellectual-property free genome 
                with improved replacements for all commonly defective exons. </p>
              <p> Experiments in digitizing and running neural wetware under emulation 
                are well-established; some radical libertarians claim that as 
                the technology matures, death - with its draconian curtailment 
                of property and voting rights - will become the biggest civil 
                rights issue of all. </p>
              <p> Some commodities are expensive: the price of crude oil has broken 
                sixty euros a barrel and is edging inexorably up. Other commodities 
                are cheap: computers, for example - hobbyists print off weird 
                new processor architectures on their home inkjets; middle aged 
                folks wipe their backsides with diagnostic paper that can tell 
                how their VHDL levels are tending. </p>
              <p> The latest casualties of the march of technological progress 
                are: the high street clothes shop, the flushing water closet, 
                the Main Battle Tank, and the first-generation of quantum computers. 
                New with the decade are cheap enhanced immune systems, brain implants 
                that hook right into the Chomsky organ and <i>talk</i> to you 
                using your own inner voice, and widespread public paranoia about 
                limbic spam. Nanotechnology has shattered into a dozen disjoint 
                disciplines, and skeptics are predicting that it will all peter 
                out before long. Philosophers have ceded qualia to engineers, 
                and the current difficult problem in AI is getting software to 
                experience embarrassment. </p>
