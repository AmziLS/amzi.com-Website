Prolog is a declarative programming language for solving complex problems.  According to A. Williams, "The ration of lines of C to lines of Prolog seemed to be about 10 to 1 for the difficult things we were trying to do."  (PC AI, May/June 1993)  It is therefore very valuable, especially for present and future professional programmers, to learn Prolog and grasp the process of solving incomplete problems through rapid prototyping.
<P>
Although various implementations of Prolog are available on the market, a powerful implementation is usually very expensive.  A rare exception  in that respect is Amzi! Prolog.  It is a standard Edinburgh Prolog with over 250 predicates which integrates interpreted and compiled code into a single system.  This means that the user can load and run both source and object code.  Furthermore, the same source and object code can be used across multiple platforms from 16 to 64-bit.  My experience with small and medium size programs suggests that compiled code runs nearly 10 times faster than interpreted code.
<P>
Amzi! Prolog Student Edition includes the standard ?- listener, a Windows-based Interactive Development System (IDE) and lots of sample programs.  Armed with on-line predicate help and DCG support, the user can edit code, debug and compile programs, log program execution, and interactively add, list and remove code.  Although the listener and the IDE offer similar functionality, the listener requires the user to know the predicates for manipulating the file system, debugger, etc., while the IDE achieves much of its functionality via menus and dialog boxes.  
<P>
The user can also link Prolog to C/C++, Visual Basic and other languages, or build distributable applications, but it requires the full Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server system which costs only $298 to $598.  (Amzi! Prolog is free to $29 for the Logic Explorer, and $79 for the Student Edition.)
<P>
Because of its user-friendly IDE, a concise and well-organized documentation and carefully selected sample programs, Amzi! Prolog has a high educational value.  In the last school year I built an expert system shell for teaching/learning mathematics using Amzi! Prolog.  This shell was utilized by my ninth-grade students who developed small-scale knowledge bases regarding algebra speed word problems.  The students were highly motivated to work with Amzi! Prolog through which they informally learned about expert systems, knowledge representation and Prolog.  They successfully built a number of interesting knowledge bases which not only improved their mathematical problem solving skills but also provided a link between their declarative and procedural knowledge in respect to problems on motion.
<P>
It is important to note that Amzi! Prolog is a product of Amzi! which is, contrary to most Prolog system developers, very much concerned with the educational aspects of Prolog.  Along with Amzi! Prolog, Amzi! offers a computer tutor that teaches Prolog, a book form of the tutor and a book on building expert systems in Prolog coupled with a disk containing complete source code for all of the expert systems developed in the book.  I have not used the tutor, but the book on expert systems is outstanding and helped me a lot in dealing with this complex area.
<P>
Overall, Amzi! Prolog is a very able Prolog embedded in a powerful programming environment.  Since its price is, contrary to most Prolog systems, very affordable for limited school budgets, I would recommend Amzi! Prolog highly to all secondary and tertiary Prolog oriented courses.
