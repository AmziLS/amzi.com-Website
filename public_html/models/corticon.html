<p>Corticon Notes</p>
<p>Talks about paradigm shift, like speadsheet - all about the virtual machines.</p>
<p>Does analysis, points out inconsistencies, recommends missing rules, logical loops, etc.</p>
<p>Does not generate Java code, makes it's own executable. Maintain at the business rule level. They become services, so the rules become a decision making service. Yes, this is what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Test suites developed at same time. Yes, just like EVA. Regression testing.</p>
<p>Generate your own operators, vocabulary management. Nice user interface!</p>
