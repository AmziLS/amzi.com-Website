<h2>VeTIS</h2>
<p>There are excellent examples of SBVR and tutorial information in the SBVR example directory under custs/iicast.</p>
<p>There is a strong resemblance between the business rules and logic puzzles. I expected the last line to be &quot;who owns the zebra?&quot;</p>
<p>VeTIS reads SBVR and converts it to UML and OCL.</p>
<p>?- VeTIS has predefined phrases, such as greater_than, is_a, etc. What does that mean? They are not part of SBVR, but are rather part of the VeTIS vocabulary that is then included -?</p>
<p>VeTIS has links to WordNet for synonyms etc. Amzi! has been noted as being particularly fast at working with WordNet.</p>
