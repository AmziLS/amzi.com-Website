<p>Project steps -</p>
<p>get a simple example, map it by hand into Prolog. see if we can do anything interesting with it, answer questions, etc.</p>
<p>note - sbvr NOT intended to have instance data, so not intended to be used to answer a question, can joe rent this car. however, the pp presentation suggests that this is not difficult to add</p>
<p>I wonder about usefulness of sbvr. One rule language never seems to fit all. Don't see using sbvr for vaccination knowledge for example. Also, IDMS installation, lots of rules all expressed in a company standard syntax, would have to be translated to and fro.</p>
<p>seems sbvr could be compiled into decision making module, ask it questions, can joe rent a car?</p>
<p>how do operative and structural rules relate? ex. necessary to have tooth brush to brush teeth. obligatory to brush teeth. so what does that say about a tooth brush? is it obligatory to have one?</p>
<p>if/then syntax discouraged for business rules, says so in rule speak documentation?</p>
<p>question - business modelling is supposed to be about the business for business purposes from a business perspective IN THE LANGUAGE USED BY BUSINESS STAFF by the business. So where does &quot;it is obligatory that ...&quot; fit into that? And what about shades of grey, in betwen obligatory and necessary is 'recommended', for example. And does it support temporal reasoning? Seems like a car rental company cares about dates and intervals etc.</p>
<p>pp notes - sbvr includes business glossary(nouns, defs, primary terms), taxonomy (heirarchies), thesaurus (synonyms, abbrev.), ontology (relationships among instances, structural rules), and operative rules (governing actions).</p>
<p>question - what is the sbvr syntax for each of those elements above?</p>
<p>different expressions of language, one form of meaning - like a common language used to translate from one language to another. That Bolivian language, forgot it's name.</p>
<p>verbs only defined in facts, i.e. relationships between nouns - ex. mgr runs company horse runs race are two different verbs. So a fact is really a verb and 1 or 2 noun relationship.</p>
<p>SBVR spec</p>
<p>Not closed world, assumes open world. No negation by failure unless specified.</p>
